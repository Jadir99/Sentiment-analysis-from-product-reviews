MattyPants_Tech,"Looking for a good, inexpensive headset that will get you banished to the basement? Look no further!",2018-07-17,"After owning and putting some heavy use into this headset for about 3 months, I can say that it's definitely a good investment. I purchased these as an alternate to my normal Turtle Beach set and I have to say for a fraction of the price you still get great sound quality and clarity.",5

K Beck,"Worth the price, good quality headset",2015-08-12,"Was looking for a replacement for my Logitech G930 (wireless, the signal cuts out) and not looking to spend more than $40. Stumbled upon these for about $25 and with overall positive reviews, decided to take a stab.",4
April,Good headset.,2023-12-31,"I bought this for my son for Christmas and he likes it. It arrived as scheduled, seems to work well accept the mic isnâ€™t working with the controller I got him. I thought it was the headset but then we tried it in his sisterâ€™s controller and the mic does work, so seems to be a controller issue not an issue with the headset.",5
Grei Jedi,They're okay. Seriously just okay.,2016-10-12,"The sound quality is not as good as my other Mad Catz F.R.E.Q. 9's, and considering these are wired and my FREQ9's are wireless, that's kinda sad. But it's doable, and I only need them when I raid anyway so it's okay. I can't really compare the two other than sound, as FREQ9's are noise cancellation and bluetooth, so I'll let it stop there. There is some bass, but as someone who likes a lot of bass it's not even adequate. Not even close. Seriously, if you like bass, even just a little bit, don't buy these. Now, aside from that, the sound is crisp and clear, and you can hear all the instruments as necessary.",3
Andrew Wilson,Absolutely horribly made and uncomfortable,2017-08-20,"So I didn't really need a new headset. I have a Sony Wireless Gold and love it. I just wanted a headset that plugs into my front IO on my pc, and had in line controls for when my headset died (I do a lot of gaming, believe it or not I will drain all 8 hours of that battery in one sitting). I also wanted a comfortable headset to switch to so I could keep comfortable.",1

GuessWho530,Pretty cool for gaming or general web chatting,2019-01-17,"Though the lighting is quite a bit bright for me, they're good for my noisy home ( 2 TVs blaring 24/7 and a dad that needs to have the TV at 85% volume )",5
Ben,Can't go wrong gaming headset,2024-05-24,Got this Headset for my son as he games a lot and needed a new headset. He likes this headset's bright red color as opposed to his last one which was black. Says the ear cups are big and comfortable even after hours of game play. Microphone is clear and says everyone can hear him loud and clear. Cable length is fine since he plays on a PC. Overall he is happy that it works well for him and I like it because it doesn't break the bank.,4
bryce,"Good product, comfortible, sounds good, mic picks up good and looks nice.",2015-01-10,"Well, let me start by saying its a good product, the LEDs are bright but not blinding, they don't distract from gaming, fact the only ones who can see them are the other people in the room or if your looking into a mirror. The head set is a bit on the big and bulky side but i believe that's the style these days and if you drop them you get that satisfaction of knowing they can take a fall, that being said tho the plastic feels soft but is strong on the sides and it looks very nice. The mic only moves up and down does not bend however it is very sensitive and picks up your voice well and i'm told sounds clearer than my old Logitech headset, you do not notice the blue LED at the end of it well gaming, meaning its not distracting.The sound is clear thru the speakers and i feel is comparable to Turtle beach or Logitech. This is met only for PC due to the fact that you use the USB for the lights, a green for sound and a red for mic also the controller is a bit big but is easy to find in dark and the volume knob is sensitive and easy to use. My only complains are the cord could be longer (however they do sell USB adapters for more length) and there's no software or box it comes in, also the fact that it comes from Hong Kong China which upon purchasing i was not made aware of and had to wait 26 days before i received the item, but was around christmas so i understand delay, but that being said it is coming directly from the manufacturer so you get that limited hands touch feeling sort a speak. i would recommend buying the faster shipping or waiting awhile if your in USA and expect a plastic bag not a fancy box but a well wrapped plastic bag. I would recommend this to my friends if there looking for a inexpensive decent headset and like a little flare to match there blue LED fans or other accessories and looking for a good mic and good stereo sound headset. Also the noise canceling aspect could be a little better but works decently for the price but if your gaming with a friend in another room you might still hear a little echo from them if they have a loud voice or yell. Also software that could dim the lights or a knob wouldn't be a bad idea just for certain occasions and if there a new to how PCs work instructions could come in handy my windows 7 didn't even detect the new hardware or install a generic driver but my sound card had inputs so it all worked out. Anyhow good product i like it id recommend it to others but not quite love it, the price was nice to and free shipping was awsome. just a few kinks to loving it.",4
