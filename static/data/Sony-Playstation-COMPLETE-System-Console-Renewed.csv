Dallas,Excellent quality!!,2024-10-06,I received my PlayStation 1 on time and in great condition. I had to purchase a converter for the av cables to an hdmi cable so I could get it to connect to the tv but other than that it is great!! Fully functioning with all the buttons working and smooth playing even with how old this system is.! I would highly recommend this to anyone who is trying to get back into their childhood like myself.,5
Lonnie Uptegrow,I'm speechless! Wow!!,2024-01-25,"You can look at all my reviews and see that I actually buy the products I review. NOTHING is given to me!!! With that being said let me say this...I have been looking for an Original Fat Playstation for months now. Primarily through Facebook Marketplace, and in my local area. I also looked 2hrs from my local area and it was a terrible experience. People list stuff and do not reply back until weeks later. So I did what was against my better judgement and decided to spend twice the amount through Amazon.",5
Victor Von Cravensworth,Does not work,2024-09-13,Looks beautiful and all the listed parts came with it HOWEVER it does not actually function properly and will not play any game's at all. The piece inside that is supposed to spin does not spin which results in it only being decor under the TV. I have tried numerous different ps1 game's in it and none of which will spin so considering I paid for a system that was supposedly checked and made sure to work (clearly a lie on there end) I give this disappointment 1 star,1
Amazon Customer,Amazing quality!,2020-05-18,"When it arrived the package was nicely wrapped in a lot of bubble wrap, and I mean a TON, so there was for sure peace of mind knowing it wasn't damaged during delivery. Everything in the picture was what was included and also wrapped individually. There is NOT a memory card included and the cabling is basic AV, only one controller too, however a controller and a memory card is not at all hard to grab from your local game store, or even ones on Amazon.",5
Fred D,They did a TOP GRADE Job or restoring the Original Play Station Console!!,2021-09-18,"Being an Old Jedi, there is a special place in my Heart for the Play station One and its original games!!! Mine finally died about 3 or for months ago, and I am not into all the new formats and games, plus my hands are not as young as they were. I also got a Dual Shock restored controller that Works GREAT! I love Playing Madden2003 Football, Resident Evil II, and Need for Speed Hot Pursuit!! IT REALLY made me Happy to have my old Friend back!!! The only thing I experienced in the beginning was it had trouble reading my Old Original CDs of the games. I cleaned my game CDs the best I could and within a week or so they are all working fine AGAIN!!! Yeah! I also bought the new redone Memory card for the Play station One!!! IT works GREAT!!! Plus it reads my old Memory cards as WELL!! I forgot who restored it but You Guys and Gals did one hell of a JOB!!! I would love to meet some of you! I think Amazon did it but am not sure! I highly recommend the Console, Controller, and Memory Card!!! All my Fellow Jedi's out there, get this and the FORCE will be with US again!!! LOL Happy Gaming!",5
Ross W. Kelly,In good shape,2024-07-30,"Works well, except some times I have to try two or three times to get it to read the disc. Once it starts, no problems, though.",4
Wife of Ellijiah,works great,2024-05-23,"this was not brand new, but it works. I'm happy with it.",5
M. Presley,"Was this ""renewed"" PlayStation fully tested?",2020-09-04,"First -star: I appreciate the HDMI cord that was included, but the PlayStation 1 does not have an HDMI port. There was no power cord included. Thankfully, I still had the power cord from my original PlayStation 1 that had stopped working a few years ago. Second -star: When I first turned on this renewed PlayStation, it did not seem to recognize that I had put a game disc into it. Once I turned the power off, and a little later decided to try again, it did read the disc and finally brought up the game's title screen. I almost gave up on it too soon. Third and 4th - stars: The title screen of the game came up, but it did not respond to the Start button - or any button - being pressed on the included controller. I tried switching to two other old controllers that I had on hand, even tried rebooting with my old controllers... the game would not respond to input from any of the controllers. This leads me to believe that something may be wrong with this unit's primary controller port. If it will not respond to controls, I cannot properly play any of my PlayStation 1 games, and my money spent for a replacement PlayStation 1 was wasted. If you want happy customers, please make sure that the unit -will work- and work with included controller(s) before sending. Just seeing a game title screen on TV is not sufficient if it will not interact with user controls. A PlayStation without the ""play"" is just a station.",1
KHENDERSON,Open button sticks,2023-05-02,I'm happy to have a system I can play. Unfortunately the open button sticks. I have to move it a little to close. I imagine for this price there would've been a discount. PLAYS GREAT!! I hope this thing doesn't get worse. I'm gonna be sad.,4
Sandra L. Wurth,Great condition!,2023-11-10,"My original PlayStation arrived quick and in excellent condition. I immediately hooked it up to my tv, inserted one of the game discs (Medieval) I’ve refused to let go of and voila! Works perfectly! The console and controller are like new. Very happy with my purchase!!",5
Steve Herron,Replacement,2024-03-28,Our old ps gave up after years of enjoyment.,5
Minty,Works great,2022-08-29,"Great used condition, works like it should. Comes with the console, cord, and original controller. Been playing tr3, almost finished the game. Definitely recommend if you're looking for a solid, quality ps1 console. Btw; I do have to restart it at the beginning sometimes (never during my game) but from memory- this is normal. Ps1 is just a bit glitchy upon start up every once in awhile. Just mentioning for the people who've never had one before.",5
M.J.,Doesn't work on the SMART TV's.,2022-04-08,I was so excited to buy this but it doesn't work on Smart TV's so I have to go buy an old style tv. Very disappointed.,4
Jose,Defective PS1,2024-03-30,"I was so exited to finally add a PlayStation 1 to my collection, I was so disappointed when the disc drive did not work. The delivery driver just dropped the box on the floor like there wasn’t an electronic device inside that could brake. Amazon should Really put a fragile sticker on the box.",1

Donald H.,Nostalgia,2021-06-17,"Ordered this expecting to get the Playstation 1, and I did. Also got 2 dual shock controllers, the AV and RFU adaptor for my TV, and even a game. Arrived way faster then Amazon's estimated date. By far, went past all my expectations, and the system works perfectly. Highly recommended!",5
Fal-Co Firearms,Works grate!!!,2020-02-27,"I am happy to say this product worked very well for me the cable it came with for audio/video out was not the correct one for a PlayStation however i had one that worked and they are cheap and easy to find the important part for me is it was defiantly rebuilt, all inner parts were obviously new, and works flawlessly.",5
Kimberly L Caie,Great condition,2023-02-17,This PlayStation runs like brand new super clean will buy one again.,5
Taylor,Won’t even turn on,2022-12-11,"Console came today and was wonderfully packaged. Pulled it out of the box and it looked brand new. I was so excited to use it, but upon setting it up and plugging it in, the console won’t even turn on. I’ve tried numerous times to make sure the AC cable is connected properly, but no matter how many times I press the power button, it just won’t turn on. Super disappointing. I was really looking forward to playing with this. The controller that came with it also had a damaged cord, as shown in the attached photo. Waiting to hear if I can get a replacement or a refund.",1
Amazon Customer,Excellent customer service!,2022-01-27,This Playstation was a Christmas gift for my husband. The console stopped reading discs after a days of use. Contacted the seller and he sent a replacement immediately. No issues with the replacement. Husband is very happy.,5

J,Shipped with faulty optical drive. Fixed it myself but plays slow. Had to buy a new one.,2021-05-24,"Product did not work upon receiving. The laser drive was gummed up so I took it apart myself and cleaned hairs and other parts out of it. Had to buy a new one for 30 bucks just to make it not so slow to load. Some of my games don't work with the faulty optical drive. Otherwise in great condition. Controller added does not function either. Please sellers, make sure the games run, don't just check if the system boots up.",2
Ryan,PS1 review.,2020-03-05,"So understand that this is an older console and it going to have its quirk. But cd driver rub cd a little bit, and also it shipped with a PS3 power cord and not a PS1 power cord.",3
Amazon Customer,Disappointed,2024-01-13,"Came in the mail and was excited, was finally going to be able to play Dino Crisis after 20+ years. Got it all set up, however it will not leave this screen while loading up. Tried with another game and same thing. Both disc have 0 scratches on them. Will most likely be turning back in for a refund",1
Nathanael S Robinson,The game system works like new!,2021-08-30,I liked how it works after all these years and it runs games best for PS over the PS3 emulation. Also like Role Playing Games and this was the system RPGs cut their teeth. No defects and came with a functioning controller too.,5

Leo,"COMPLETELY BROKEN, DAMAGED RARE GAME",2021-11-21,"This console came completely broken. The ""open"" button was broken on arrival and the console did not run any games, even after a couple hours of troubleshooting. I also unfortunately discovered this console damaged one of my very rare ps1 games by scratching the disk while trying to run. There are plenty of other, cheaper and more reliable places to buy classic consoles. Do yourselves and your games a favor and shop somewhere else.",1

Very disappointed in quality of products being sold by ""sellers"", not Amazon, yet this product is supposedly ""amazon renewed."" There was no ""renewed"" on this product. My last order!",1
Ben Wehrs,Just like the PlayStation of old.....,2020-11-02,I have owned two PlayStation back in the day and I keep all of my games to play whenever I'm feeling nostalgic. But neither of them are working now so I bought this to play my games. Everything was cool until about 15 minutes when the system reset itself out of nowhere. Being an old-school PlayStation owner...i knew that this happens to most of them. The trick is to flip the system UPSIDE down on a pillow. It reset 3 times until I did this. Played over 20 hours and it hasn't done it again. It would be nice if it worked properly...but this is a typical glitch from this system. Be prepared for some ghetto tricks if you buy one.,3
