Catalyst66,"Lighweight, Durable, and Protective!",2024-09-28,"The DOMISO 15.6 inch Laptop Protective Case is a sleek and practical solution for keeping your laptop safe during daily commutes or travel. After using this case for my own 15.6-inch laptop, I‚Äôm impressed with its functionality, design, and overall protection.",5
S. G.,Cute and Sturdy!,2024-10-02,"I love this laptop case, so far! It is light but tough and looks stylish. I chose mint green. It is roomy for my little 13.3 inch 2 in 1 PC. For added functionality, it holds my other accessories in a pocket and the laptop is secured by a strap.",5
RobertF,Very durable. Lightweight,2024-10-02,I like the snug fit it provides my laptop. Reasonably priced.,5
Shane,"A very rugged case, however...",2024-10-23,"However, it is so skinny that it can only carry the laptop and some papers. There is no room for a power supply, mouse, etc.",4
Krypto,Awesome case,2024-10-07,I love this case. Looks good and excellently made product.,5
michael Labadie Hudson Florida,Very very useful for me and the 12.7 Lenovo tablet great protection.,2024-10-18,I do like this carry case easy to use and I can easily place the 12.7 tablet into the flat top to use as a stable table thank you so much for this protection.ü•πüê∂,5
MW,No space for power cord.,2024-10-18,"It's a really nice, sturdy case but there is no place for a powe cord. Kind of odd and impractical. It works for us because it's for my son's laptop that generally never leaves our house (I was more worried about the hard shell for kidproofing) but it wouldn't work for me / commuting with a laptop.",3
Britney Groomes,Great case,2024-06-14,"Pros: it looks beautiful, the color is gorgeous. It has an inside pocket for papers or whatever, good value for the price, is light weight and adequate padding for protection.",5
chris r polk,Go oversized if you want to fit extra items,2024-10-17,"I am adding this review because I had unanswered questions when I ordered this product. I ordered the 17 inch so that I can fit my .8‚Äù usb C charger and/or my stock hp 1.25‚Äù thick dc charger. I found that it will close without a struggle set up this way. The 1.25‚Äù thick brick bulges a little, but not a lot. The .8‚Äù thick usb c brick fits easily. I probably could have gone with the 15 inch case and still fit the USB C charger, but it would bulge a bit and would put pressure on the laptop. It would be functional, but I would be nervous about hitting the bulge which would pressure the laptop. Hope this helps if you have similar questions.",5
Bazi's Mom,Color is beautiful! Case is large and bulky but protective,2024-10-15,This case color is beautiful!! Good value for money if you just need something to carry your computer around in.,4

Kevin Schubert,Product appears to be durable,2024-09-12,"I dislike the shipping the item was not in a box or shippers pouch. The product appears in a clear plastic sleeve. Driver left at front door never rang door bell. Fortunately, I was there and was notified by Alexia that a package had arrived 5 minutes later.",4

Jeremia,Could be thicker,2024-09-11,"Because it isn't very thick, you can't put much in the pocket without risking damage to the laptop. I just have a couple usb cable in mine. Other than that, it is a decent case.",4
