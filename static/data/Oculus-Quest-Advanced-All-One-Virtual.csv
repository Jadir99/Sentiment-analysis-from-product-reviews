P-Town Cracker,Pricey and awesome mechanical keyboard,2020-03-08,"When a rogue Win 10 update took out my Gskill KM780 RGB unexpectedly, I had to pull the trigger fast on a new KB instead of having to endure using my spare membrane board. After a solid day of research, I took a chance on the Apex Pro.",5
Bill_Ben,Very impressive high quality product,2024-10-17,The Steelseries Apex Pro is a superb keyboard. (Apology for the superlative!). It has been my favorite for the 10 days during which I tried seven other brands of keyboards.,5
SM Family Reviews,Wonderful Keyboard. I got a Steal,2024-07-07,"Damaged Box But understandable since I got a refurbished Option For like 70$ Less. It was “Like new” if you're asking. It is such an exceptional gaming keyboard! The SteelSeries Apex Pro Mini Wireless is a game-changer with its compact 60% form factor. The adjustable actuation feature allows for a personalized typing experience, and the HyperMagnetic switches provide a responsive and tactile feel. Not that heavy and not that light. Battery was on 5% on arrival but all good, I just charged it and upgraded the firmware on the app. The RGB lighting is vibrant and customizable, adding a great aesthetic touch. The PBT keycaps are durable and feel premium. Connectivity options are fantastic with Bluetooth, 2.4GHz wireless, and USB-C. This keyboard is perfect for both gaming and everyday use. Highly recommend for those looking for a high-performance, compact keyboard! Ease of Use Is Good",5
Matt F.,Nice mechanical keyboard.,2024-08-26,"Bought one to replace an aging Corsair K-70 Mk.2 RGB. Comparing the two, the Steelseries has easier to use software (less buggy or resource heavy) and the color range and intensity of the LEDs is greater than on the Corsair. The Corsair software seems to allow you to do a bit more with regards to effects, but I am still learning the ins and outs of the SS app. The cons to this keyboard is the LCD menu has various options (like brightness) buried several levels deep and I miss having a dedicated brightness key that I could just tap. Also, for some odd reason the Enter, Tab and Caps Lock keys are not labeled but rather just use symbols. A very small nit to pic but I would have preferred these were still labeled as on other keyboards. I really like the wrist guard with its slightly pliable rubber coating. the keys are sufficiently clicky without being too loud. As for the adjustable sensitivity setting, seems a bit overhyped. I just left everything at the default and seems to work ok but then I am not trying any competition gaming so YMMV. One last comment is with the scroll wheel. It can be clicked or scrolled but I have found that if you try and rotate it away from the edge, it can seem to *stick* a bit. You have to scroll it from just the top edge and then it scrolls more or less freely, but never as smoothly as the one on the Corsair keyboards.",5
Jeff,"Among the best keyboards I've used, BUT... (updated review)",2020-07-10,"UPDATE: I still really like this keyboard, but I was starting to notice that I actually type really inaccurately on it - it does get annoying. I just make a lot of mistakes, and I've been typing for 40 years and normally type about 100wpm. I was trying to figure out why this is, and lately I've had my old IBM Model M in the room hooked up to another computer and have felt the obvious difference in accuracy. (The Model M is where the modern keyboard layout comes from.) I still just type much better on the Model M. So I directly compared the two keyboards to figure out what the difference is.",4
African John,One of the greatest keyboards of all time.,2024-08-22,"This keyboard is insanely nice and high quality, the brightness of the RGB is really bright and the durability is really good. The size of the mini makes it so that it can fit on my desk giving space to my mouse. The only reason that I'm returning this mouse was because the switches just weren't the right ones for me and I decided I would replace the apex pro mini with the Asus rog azoth 75% with the red switches.",5
Marcus Hynek,Get keyboard,2024-10-01,"This is my first somewhat mechanical keyboard, as well as magnetic switch keyboard board and it’s the best keyboard I’ve ever used. I’ve played around with some of the settings briefly just to set it up for a very responsive typing experience I’m very impressed with the key feel, response and noise on the mag switches and same goes for the cherry Mx reds in the rest of the keyboard. You can set it to as little as a wiggle of the keys triggers a press. I set it for 4mm for standard typing",5
Donald Fletcher,Not worth the price. Feature coverage is limited and the device is held back by poor design.,2024-04-07,This keyboard isn't worth a third the price you pay for it. I'd have given this an extra star if I hadn't paid a premium for it; the cost in conjunction with how it just barely checks the boxes on its basic feature descriptions drops my rating to rock bottom.,1
Chuck,Love the keyboard but not the wrist result nor that all keys are NOT adjustable…,2024-08-18,"So far the keyboard has been everything I have wanted… almost. Great feel to typing, adjustable actuation(although NOT on all keys). The keycaps have a great feel to them and the lighting is excellent.",4
Michael Dahmane,A great keyboard for those who don't game.,2024-10-14,"Short and sweet: I write for a living. Unlike other keyboards, this one lacks latency issues. The accuracy of my typing has skyrocketed. Moreover, as someone with arthritis in his hands, the wrist rest is amazing. Because it's magnetized I don't have to worry about it slipping around. My hand pain has plummeted since I used this for office work. And while there are other keyboards that advertise themselves as ergonomic, this one actually reduces my hand pain. Is this pricy? Yes. Do I think it's weird that I use a gaming keyboard for office work? Yeah, in a good way. Would I recommend it to my friends who don't game and have hand issues? I already have. The other features of the keyboard are nice for gaming, but that's not really my bag anymore. And given that I bang away on this thing for 8-14 hours a day for work, I can attest to the fact that it is durable. You'll save money on it in the long run if you buy this and don't run through other keyboards. One of the best purchases I ever made.",5
David Elías Cuello Mora,De lo mejor en teclados,2024-08-19,"El SteelSeries APEX Pro es, sin duda, uno de los teclados mecánicos más impresionantes en el mercado actual. Desde el primer momento, destaca por su construcción robusta y diseño elegante, con un marco de aluminio de calidad aeronáutica que asegura durabilidad y un toque de sofisticación.",5
Khora,Better choice than Wooting,2024-10-09,I purchased a Wooting keyboard and this SteelSeries.,5
Nathan123,It’s really only good for really competitive games,2024-10-07,"As a keyboard itself, it’s okay. The typing experience isn’t the best either rapid trigger enabled unless you have really good control. The actuation point is noticeable but not that impactful. The only people who this is really good for is like top tier pros in games, but not just the average person trying. Although I will say the keys sound amazing.",4
C. Sinclair,Apex Pro Mini - highly recommended but make sure you get the right width for your needs,2024-09-05,"It's a nice keyboard. I love the way typing feels and sounds but I'm returning it because it's very narrow and I don't like it. I use the keyboard on my lap and this one just doesn't sit right because it's so narrow. I like it otherwise those so I ordered the same keyboard but in the wider variant. I got the Apex Pro TKL which has the arrow keys, page up/down, home, end, delete and insert. That makes it just wide enough for me. And I love the feature where you can adjust how far you have to push the keys in. This keyboard along with the other Apex Pro keyboards have awesome features. Highly recommended!!",4
Carl Peters,Great daily gaming keyboard,2024-10-17,"Great overall little keyboard. Little to no latency. Steelseries software not invasive. Connects via a fake USB-C ;) (USB-A to USB-C essentially throttles all USB-C functionality). Great 60% sized keyboard, especially if you can get it on sale. Switches on keyboard sound great.",5
avid reader,Unhappy with no outer shipping box on product,2024-09-26,While the product is good and does what it needs to do it was shipped to me with no outer shipping box around it. It wasn't marked as a gift and not concerned from that standpoint but left on porch this expensive item clearly picturing exactly what it is could have easily been a target for theft. I lucked out but if this is standard shipping practice others may not be as lucky.,4
t_la_la,My Nephew Loved It,2024-10-11,"This was a gift for my nephew's 14th birthday. He loves it, so I would guess it's working perfectly. He tried to explain how much better the ""touchpoints"" are for his gaming, but I have no idea what any of it means. He's happy, I'm happy :).",5
lydia hill,Really fast,2024-10-11,It’s kinda expensive but it’s a really fast keyboard I would Recommend for people who play Fortnite Or any movement game it has 0.1 accusation the brightness is good the clicks sound amazing the durability is Good the weight is kinda light the size is good,5
Steve W.,My son's favorite,2024-10-16,"My son has went through more than his fair share of keyboards, always thinking there was something better. He has finally settled on this one and is very happy. Customizable screen on keyboard.",5
N,Its ok,2024-10-15,"Build quality is not great, doesn’t sound that good, keys feel pretty wobbly, slight texture to keycaps, crap software but the switches are cool",4
Eowyn,Fortnite players read this!!!,2024-10-03,I love this it is soooo fast. I love the feel and for all of you fortnite players it is super fast. Editing and doing 90s feel soo nice got so new keycaps on it but I LOVE THIS,5
Isabel Page,amazing keyboard 😍,2024-09-14,"i’ve owned a few keyboards from Logitech to Razer and this far exceeds any keyboard I have ever used. The switches are so incredibly smooth and fast, I absolutely love it. I got it on sale too for $113 which it is right now so if you are considering it THIS IS UR SIGN BUY IT !!",4
K O,One of the top 3 mech boards,2023-03-16,"If you are like me and looking at this board, you may be getting frustrated at how hard it is to find that nearly perfect board that should exist, when you're willing to drop over $230.",4
GreatGooglyMoogly,Really just a perfect keyboard,2024-09-13,"Honestly have no complaints. When pressing a key it feels like silky smooth butter, the rgb is really cool, size is pretty big and nice with a solid base and good durability. As expected of an absolute unit of a keyboard for the price it is. It is pretty heavy for keyboard standards though, so beware of that if you need a lighter keyboard.",5
Terrorgod,"Great gaming keyboard, not my style for typing",2022-04-10,"The steelseries apex pro mechanical gaming keyboard is a keyboard I really wanted to love. I have been looking forward to being able to have the best of both worlds with fast linear switches when I'm gaming and need every advantage I can get, and going back to a high quality typing experience when I am living the professional life. Maybe this keyboard will be that for some people, as the switches themselves are subject to the users preference. However I can share my experience and preferences to hopefully guide whether or not this keyboard is good for you.",3

K,I Do Like It,2024-01-31,"Well firstly I'm gonna tell anyone reading this to get it in the Amazon box cause I had to order it twice since the driver stole the first one, which was probably my own fault for trying to save packaging since it gives you the option to not have the extra box since it ships in a box. Amazon did refund though since it was never delivered.",4

Byron,Apex Pro Full Size Keyboard for the win,2024-04-04,"I finally had the opportunity to invest in a high-end keyboard, and after doing a lot of research, I decided to go by SteelSeries Apex Pro Full Size. I play rhythm games, in which I need to press several buttons at the same time. I am glad that this keyboard has Full N-Key Rollover. So far, I have tested 53 keys pressed at the same time, and it registers all keys with no problem.",5
Krenzzler,"Almost perfect, if not for the competition",2022-08-17,"TLDR: If you don't want to deal with pre-ordering the Wooting60HE or just really like Steelseries products, this is a really good 60% option.",4
Amazon Customer,apex pro mini,2024-09-15,Great keyboard just what i wanted.,5
Peter M Wright,Good Keyboard with Small Desktop Foot Print,2021-06-13,I'll preface this review with my biases for it. I got the keyboard because I'm shifting my computer time into digital art and the keyboard has to play nice with the Wacom tablet I have. So the keyboard needs to be on the same level as the tablet.,4
Angela,good keyboard,2024-08-27,had it a year and the only issue I had was the keys stopped responding unless I pressed multiple times real hard. I factory reset it and its going strong again,5
Breonne Smith,Fast!,2024-08-06,My son says his gaming is so fast now. Great buy.,4
JeffreyK,Good keyboard,2024-05-09,"Keyboard has been good so far. No problems. I read about the issue where the keyboard would spam keys. I think this is an issue with either messy macros and setting the actuation to low. I notice that sometimes, some of the keys are pressed around 0.2 mm without me pressing them. Might be the weight of the keycaps.",5
Stanley,Not worth the money. Battery is horrible. Aesthetically great but overshadowed by all the bad.,2024-03-17,"After a year of using the Apex Pro TLK, I had to switch back to the Logitech G915.",3

Becky,Christmas gift,2024-08-28,"My son is a gamer and requested this keyboard for Christmas..... he said the ""trigger"" is fast and works great~",5
Gabriel,Fairly underwhelming,2024-03-17,"Steelseries did a decent job with the half effect switches, but there's a lot more to a keyboard than just features. The sound of this keyboard is very loud due to the thin frame, so the sound just pings a ton. Because of that, typing is pretty loud and is not satisfying to type on IMO. What's the worst about the sound is the spacebar. My goodness, this space bar rattles and is so loud when pressing it. Maybe I've been used to better sounding mechanical keyboards, but this one just doesn't cut it for the price I paid.",3
Chance,Amazing,2024-08-10,"Amazing keyboard and a better ergonomics for the wrist than most keyboard. Can use for hours and no discomfort. Smooth key presses, and also is a good quiet keyboard especially if you don't like the mechanical switches. Software is easy to use. pretty self explanatory.",5
Jdrames,It's almost perfect. But there is a glaring design issue.,2024-02-19,"While I still love my keyboard. There is one major design issue that keeps me from giving it full stars. That issue is the shift key symbols. Instead of like every other keyboard where the number row and punctuation keys all have the primary key prominently on the key and then the ""shift"" alternative above that, this keyboard has them below. This is very unintuitive and I can't think of any reason for them doing this. And while I know all my normal used keys, this causes issues when I need to type something like the pipeline""|"" character. Because if I look at the keyboard it's the that character appears on the bottom of the key.",4
Carlitos,Amazing and crazy fast,2024-08-30,No words just a great keyboard,5
Gary S.,Love this keyboard and the little OLED screen on the corner. You can't beat this price.,2024-07-31,"I love this keyboard and the little OLED screen in the corner. I didn't want to get into custom keyboards because I felt it was a bit too much, but this keyboard is perfect for me. The price is reasonable, and the OLED screen allows you to change the animation. I haven't mess with the ""Adjustable Hypermagentic switches"" settings yet, but the feels on it is really good already. Not too clicky but still makes the noise. Its perfect.",5
Joseph,this keyboard is AMAZING,2024-08-08,I have used this keyboard for Fortnite and other gaming titles it has been a great use but i stopped gaming i gave it to my brother and he doesn't want to take his hands off of it,5
Alex,Look for keyboards with the same price but more features,2024-09-23,"I really do not like having to use Steelseries GG to use this keyboard. The keyboard itself is pretty decent, but the software really makes it not worth purchasing.

hyung hong,Good for valorant,2024-07-15,Gf really likes it!,4
Amazon lover,Great for gaming and typing,2023-08-07,"I bought this keyboard to replace my Logitech RGB G910, which I had purchased in 2017 for $130. That was a great gaming keyboard, but for typing it wasn't very good at all. So I figured I was due for an upgrade and after a bit of research, settled on the SteelSeries Apex Pro TKL 2023. So far, I am very impressed at how the keyboard handles both gaming and regular typing workloads. The keys are ultra sensitive (key sensitivity can be modified) and responsive which makes typing very fast and accurate, especially compared to my previous G910 which was infamous for requiring heavy keystrokes. The Apex Pro TKL 2023 by comparison needs far lighter keystrokes.",5
@theDavidLeach,"Replaced my slightly older Apex Pro TKL, this is not the same quality",2024-03-05,"I ordered this simply to utilize a USB-C cable with a coiled cable with OLED aesthetic. I assumed that since this keyboard is newer, it would possess better components. I was sorely mistaken.",2
tajobe,"Great keyboard, disappointing longevity/QC",2024-08-01,"This keyboard is great for light and fast key actuation and is a pleasure to type with. The size and weight are exactly what I was looking for. SteelSeries GG/Prism do the job, and I appreciate the utility that SteelSeries is trying to provide in GG for free and without an account.",3
Vicente Maluenda,Increible,2024-08-05,"Es una experiencia totalmente ajena a lo qué estuve acostumbrado, realmente se siente la calidad de los materiales así como también la rapidez del teclado, 100% recomendado.",5
Matthew,Not bad but not great,2024-08-13,I was pretty disappointed by the quality of the keyboard for the price. The whole thing is lightweight plastic and feels pretty cheap. Doesn't rattle at all which was good but the key press is extremely short and doesn't feel like you are pressing anything but when you do press the key stroke IMO can be described as heavy but short. At the end of the day it's all personal opinion on keyboards but this was not the one for me. Love their headphones though!,3
Saleem Griggs-Taylor,"THIS KEYBOARD IS BADA**, BUT!!......",2023-11-23,"I am far from a ""true"" gamer. But I did play occasionally and I don't own a gaming tower. I wanted this keyboard for work to give my office desk a bit more appeal and character while I work. I am EXTREMELY happy I purchased this keyboard. This thing is RIDICULOUSLY configurable from the LED patterns you want to use to the level of response the keys can give! I am honestly blown away at how a company made such a keyboard haha and for this I can see justification in the price. I am rating this now with the future intent that the reliability is also strong but I will rerate if things begin to fall apart sooner than expected.",3

Ordinary Bloke,The magnetic keys feel really good to type on.,2024-07-12,"Really nice keyboard, I am usually a hardcore cherry keys only due to the very satisfying clicking those make.

Shawn Hayes,Good keyboard,2024-04-15,"It's a solid keyboard, and the ability to tune the actuation point is extremely useful for gaming, and you can change the force needed for all the main keys. Do be aware though that SteelSeries considers it ""legacy"" so RMA replacement would be for a different keyboard should anything happen it it. That's the only real downside so far.",4
Chris,The best keyboard I've ever had.,2024-05-28,"Aside from looking and feeling great, I've had mine for 3 years and it's still in amazing condition. I've had other keyboards from the snake company but they all usually started having multiple key burnouts and broken keycaps within a year or two. With this keyboard, one of the RGB LEDs on my D key burned out so the color on that key can't display the full range, but that's it. When I set an oscillating rainbow pattern or something I don't even notice it. This thing is built to last. I would recommend this keyboard to anyone.",5
nick,Amazing keyboard.,2024-06-23,"This is the most unique keyboard I have ever used. It comes with loads of amazing features and it is the fastest keyboard I ever used. Once I started using this keyboard I couldn't get used to a normal keyboard due to the heavy delay I notice with the input. It has great lighting features, nice sounding switches, and the wireless feature is a great way to clean up your gaming space.",5
OutlawChad,Amazing keyboard,2024-05-27,I was a little scriptural about spending so much on a keyboard but once I received this I knew it was a quality item. It’s got good weight to it and it doesn’t slide around on my desk. The keys feel great compared to the $10 oem keyboard I was using. Wish I had gotten something a little more quiet but the rest of the keyboard makes up for it. Glad I bought it and would recommend it if you want a high quality keyboard with amazing lighting options,5
Christopher Vance,I’m a Pro,2023-04-24,"Let me start off by saying that I'm a professional gamer. I'm so professional, I put the ""pro"" in ""procrastination.""

Henry,Best value rapid trigger keyboard,2023-09-29,**Pros:**,4
Rover,"Great keyboard, wireless unecessary",2024-01-24,"The wireless version goes to sleep after a minute or two of no interaction. Making it frustrating to use wirelessly. You wake up the keyboard by tapping a key, and it takes like 3-5 seconds to start, which is way too long when it shuts off so often. Also it's sad to see Steel Series cut costs on this product. The main qwer keys are made with the new nice switches. But the arrow keys, function keys and home keys are a different switch. Minus a star for cutting costs on a $250 keyboard.",4

Stephan T.,"Its Great, but has it's issues.",2024-02-06,"The keyboard itself is fantastic. It is ridiculously good in-game and feels great to type on. The LCD display is useful and I found it to be extremely convenient. The only problem however is the software. It's insanely slow and clunky to use, and it's reset my lighting profiles numerous times out of nowhere (usually fixes itself when I open the app). I do prefer this keyboard over anything else i've used, yet I really wish the software was better, because then it would be a flawless keyboard.",4

Victor C.,Absolutely killer deal for a great keyboard with excellent new tech,2023-09-09,"At the time of writing this review, this keyboard is on sale at 120 dollars. This keyboard is absolutely excellent with hall effect sensors and the new rapid trigger software update. The switches feel great (come fully lubricated), the keycaps are surprisingly high quality with a nice textured finish, the backplate is aluminum, and the case is lined with sound dampening foam. The keyboard by itself with standard mechanical switches would be well worth the money, but coming with hall effect sensors makes it an absolute no brainer. The software is pretty clunky, but fairly easy to navigate (make sure to update the firmware of the board and enable rapid trigger). The elephant in the room is the compairison to Wooting 60 HE, which is very slighty better in most ways (slightly faster by a few milliseconds which doesnt really matter, the overall build quality is sligtly nicer, and the software is much easier to use). The silver bullet to the wooting is the price and availability of this board. This board is about 1/3 the cost and availabe to ship next day with prime for a board that is 90% as good. At the time of this review the Wooting board has a 2 month waiting period before shipment. I highly recommend this keyboard to anyone who is interested in trying out a hall effect sensor keyboard.",5
Noah,Best gaming keyboard,2024-05-14,Love it,4
David,Pretty good,2024-03-24,"Lighting, reaction time and everything else about is great. The only complaint is since the wrist wrest is non slip, it seems to stick to lint. The keys are a little heavy as well but those are my only two complaints. I love it so far.",4
David Prostejovsky,"Great keyboard, okay build quality",2024-04-11,"Great keyboard, my only complaint is the plastic housing. It feels very premium outside of the plastic bottom and would be much better if aluminum.",4
JJ,No more banging the keyboard!,2021-10-30,"I got this and a Rival wired mouse for my son’s birthday. He plays a lot of Roblox with his friends and I constantly hear him hammer fisting his desk in anger because his wireless keyboard and mouse would lag and make him vulnerable in shooter games. He was so excited to get the keyboard and mouse. Not only does it look super cool, but you can adjust the actuation of the keys. You can make it so you barely have to touch the key, to fully pressing the key all the way down in order to send the command. The keyboard feels like it's built to last, nice and sturdy, and has a real nice mechanical feel when typing. I pop in every now and then when he's playing a Roblox shooter game with his friends and ask if the keyboard and mouse are working alright. He always tells me they work flawlessly, in fact he said his click speed is a lot faster now. I'm not gamer, but I understand your competition will kick your butt if you're playing with sub par tools. It's been a week and I have yet to hear any angry hammer fisting of his desk.😁 In fact, I was watching him play the other night when a Roblox YouTuber joined his server. He got all excited and said the person was one of the highest ranked players in the game he was playing. He took out the YouTuber several times, but ultimately came in second to him each round until the YouTuber moved on. My son was totally stoked and said there's no way he would have been able to compete with the old wireless keyboard and mouse. Awesome, you don't always hit a home run with presents, but this might be one. If only it would make him excited to do his homework.🙄",5

I clean it pretty regularly as well.",3
Matthew,overpriced unrepairable eventual garbage,2024-04-18,"There is actually a lot to like about this keyboard. Being able to adjust the distance each key has to be depressed can be very useful, especially if you switch between an office setting and gaming. The lighting is fine. I can't speak too well to that, because literally all I care about is that the keys are lit up so I can read them in the dark on the rare occasion I need to do so.",2
RFM,"Nice keyboard, nice features, amazing RGB!",2022-05-06,"This keyboard is great. It's good for typing or gaming. The whole board feels well made and solid, I think it'll last a while.

stacy,Great for gamers,2024-06-06,"I’ve been using the SteelSeries Apex Pro Mini Wireless and it’s awesome. The 60% size is super convenient for my desk and gaming. Being able to adjust the key sensitivity is a cool feature. The HyperMagnetic switches are really responsive, and the RGB lights look great. Plus, the keycaps feel really sturdy. Definitely recommend it for any gamer.",5
Abdulmalik Varnham,The greatest keyboard ever,2024-06-21,"This is just too good, I was surprised by how black the keys are but when it lights up with the rbg it looks amazing. Idc about any cons, even if there are any its too minor compared to the pros.",5
Adam Strobel,Unstoppable keyboard,2024-06-17,I bought this 4 years ago on 2020 and never write reviews. I would be a spokes person for steel series at this point. Everything functions great and today I spilled a full glass of cranberry juice across the entire keyboard and EVERY key works still. 100% buying steel series again.,5
Amazon Customer,"Excellent Value, Works as Advertised",2024-05-13,"Well-constructed and sturdy from quality materials. Rapid trigger function works exactly as advertised. The software is a tad encumbersome and could be more intuitive, but you only need to deal with it once - it's set and forget. The Wooting 60E is the market's best rapid-trigger keyboard, but this SteelSewries keyboard plenty good, and is available with no wait time. Overall, a great value if you can find one refurbished/used in ""Good"" or better condition.",5
Jase,Simply the best,2024-05-08,"I adore this keyboard, the ability to change actuation point is something I thought would be incredibly gimmicky - but I couldn't imagine using a keyboard without it.",5
Sung Choi,"Overpriced, but great keyboard",2023-09-09,"As with any gaming keyboard, this is easily overpriced by like 50 bucks. However, I will say that among the gaming keyboards that are out there, this one really feels good to type on. I absolutely adore the customization options that come with the key switch.",4
Robert,Cheapest $200 keyboard out there,2024-04-30,"Let me just start by saying that the Rapid Trigger and Actuation adjusting gives an edge in gaming. HOWEVER, The keyboard feels like a cheap knockoff keyboard. The wrist rest feels more premium than the keyboard. My last one was a Logitech G915, and it had a sublime typing experience. Unfortunately it died after 3 years of heavy use. The lighting could be improved, nowhere near as bright as pictures show. OLED screen is neat but it's not realistic in the sense of it being hard to read unless you're in the dark (on max brightness). First wireless keyboard that has to pair and unusable for first 5-10 seconds upon waking from sleep. If you want the OLED screen, Asus ROG Azaroth is the way to go.",3
Weston Dancewicz,"I like it, but don’t like how easily the arm wrest detaches.",2024-07-21,"Like the title says above, I really like this keyboard. What I don’t like is how easily the armrest detaches. If it wasn’t for the armrest, I would probably give this thing five stars.",3
Gerson Castillo,apex pro mini wireless,2024-01-17,"Hola amazon , hace 1 dia compre un teclado llamado ¨apex pro mini wireless¨ y funciona pero el tema de las luces del teclado no me prenden como deberia ser , quisiera saber si esta mal el teclado o solo es tema de configurar porque no me prenden las luces, espero saber tu respuesta.",4
Da Wolf,Wish it had Customizable extra Buttons,2023-05-23,"So far this is the best mechanical keyboard I've have the pleasure of using. Coming from using the EVGA Z20, the keys on this one aren't as hard to press and the ability to adjust the sensor depth is epic. For someone who's a speed typer like myself being able to change that so I can go from a low setting to speed type an email to a higher setting for gaming is fantastic.",4
Travis,Durable,2024-07-01,"Good size, and quite durable, works very well for gaming, came in very good shape, good quality, was definitely worth the money.",5
Rishabh Verma,"Good Keyboard, bad programming and magnets",2024-03-06,"The magnets on the pads come off easily. I LOVE the keyboard feel and its custom settings for actuations, but I dont like that the profile doesnt get saved at times",4
Nick Dijkhuizen,Best I ever had,2024-07-04,"Only have to get used to the density of the key placement, but this happened quite fast for me",5
Reckon,Good for gamers,2024-06-08,"Purchased for my son. The keyboard is not sharp, not too noisy and efficient both for gaming and for lessons and document work, as my son uses the same computer both for gaming and studies. Happy with this purchase.",5
