eric dykstra,"Amazing performance, beautiful build",2024-09-22,"The new ASUS ROG STRIX G16 gaming laptop I tried out has exceeded my expectations in terms of quality and graphics capabilities. The sleek but robust metal construction of the laptop provide durability and luxury, making it a standout choice for gaming enthusiasts. The graphics performance of this laptop is exceptional from the graphics card and delivering stunning visuals and smooth gameplay that enhance the overall gaming experience, much better from a laptop than i expected. The high-resolution display and advanced graphics technology bring games to life with vibrant colors and sharp detail. Overall, the ASUS G16 has exceeded my expectations, keeping cool under heavy loads, running games well, and a bulletproof build.",5
Mike L,Excellent Deal! Great Gaming Laptop!,2023-12-09,I wanted to buy another laptop for work purposes but also be useful for travelling and for gaming so I saw this laptop for sale during Black Friday! Excellent purchase! Here is my pros and cons after a week of owning this:,5
Anthony,Decent Gaming laptop 2024,2024-10-15,"I was kind of skeptical about this laptop and the software it has. I had ordered a different gaming laptop previous to this one. The other laptop had really bad software issues and I had to return it because out of no where the screen turned black and returned it. I thought that if I ordered this different one and thought it might of have the same software issues and didn't want a deal with that. Anyhow I saw that this Asus Rog Strix G16 2024 model was on sale for Prime Day and bought it for $1,100. I'm glad that I bought it during this Prime Day sale because at this price you get a mid range gaming laptop with a good processor and a Nvidia Geforce Rtx 4060 graphics card. This laptop comes with a 16gb DDR5 4800mhz memory ram card, I wanted to upgrade it so I bought a 64gb DDR5 which is the maximum. The manufacture listed the maximum memory ram at 32gb, but that's not true, I did research and Crucial has tested the 64gb ram and it is compatible with this laptop model. Now I'm a wait for Black Friday and buy a 4tb Crucial PCie ssd drive, and with that I'll be set. The laptop is already fast and it's pretty descent but I want to upgrade it, I highly recommend it.",5
Yunjue,ASUS is always a good choice,2024-08-29,"I am satisfied with the overall performance of this laptop, but there are some issues to note.",4
Jorge Lopez,Best laptop price/specs,2023-12-28,"The specs are really good for this laptop. I love how you can even play with 100 FPS or even more in some games (Halo infinite, Apex Legends, The Finals) with the silent mode (without overheating or having the max power of the CPU/GPU). If you want to get over 100+, the turbo mode (taking full advantage of the GPU/CPU) will be great + the 165.1 Hz. The only ""issue"" (not issue honestly if you do not see this as problem) is the turbo mode makes the laptop sounds a bit loudly which is normally when you are utilizing it with the full capacity. Other than that, you can have an amazing experience playing on this mode.",5
Jeremy Chicaiza,MURI√ì COMPLETAMENTE A LOS 3 D√çAS DE QUE LLEG√ì,2024-08-26,"La compr√© hace unas dos semanas y 3 d√≠as despu√©s ya no funcionaba, muri√≥ completamente. La verdad no s√© que problema surgi√≥. Todo empez√≥ cuando estaba jugando y de la nada se reinicio la Laptop, cu√°ndo la encend√≠ no reconoc√≠a la tarjeta gr√°fica de NVIDIA, la volv√≠ a reiniciar y muri√≥ completamente, no eran por las temperaturas ni nada de eso, siempre que juego checo la temperatura y dem√°s cosas del procesador, etc; asimismo pens√© que ser√≠a algo de d√≥nde estaba conectado el cargador, pero tambi√©n lo destaque, ya que estaba conectada un regulador de voltaje, en el cual ya hab√≠a tenido conectada una pc gamer con altas especificaciones anteriormente ü§î Todo estaba yendo normal y sucedi√≥ lo peor üòî. Dej√≥ de encender, no reconoc√≠a el cargador ni nada. Pienso que tuve muy mala suerte con el modelo que me lleg√≥.",1
Jesse R.,Great machine.,2024-08-29,The ROG hub is so useful for gamers. And can be placed out of the way entirely when its work time. My daughter is elated. Holds up to hours of play with plenty of cooling. Perfect color and battery life.,5
Nine Douglas,Very powerful for the price,2024-10-04,"So far I haven‚Äôt had any issues with the PC. It‚Äôs very powerful for the price you‚Äôre getting. runs all of my AAA titles on ultra on an average of 90 fps. The fan really doesn‚Äôt bother me but you will hear it when you have it on turbo mode. Very smooth. The speakers are OK, very average i can say. The size is perfect not to big not to small. To be honest it‚Äôs seems pretty thin in my eyes. I would recommend this for new owners that want to play on PC.",5
Kevin Kiggs,Amazing machine,2024-08-04,"It's a big and beautiful laptop that slurps up all games like jam while staying very quiet by laptop standards. Expect high framerates and few frame dips thanks to high CPU limits, but with a few caveats.",4
Tyrone Walters,"Overall very happy, but not perfect.",2024-08-29,"Overall performance wise and everything I have had no problems. It runs well for gaming, hitting max settings for Baldurs Gate 3 and Elden Ring. I only experience small stutters in Elden ring. My main cons are that the battery life is extremely short. Luckily I usually have it plugged in so it's not a problem, but if you plan to use it off charger you might want to look elsewhere. Also all of the USB ports are on the right side, so if you're right handed using a wired mouse it makes it a bit clunky and crowded with the wiring right there. But those are minor issues for me and I am happy with the purchase.",4
TrudyL Gaudin,This isnt a 2024 model.,2024-09-15,"I hate the bloat that comes on new phones, new cars and especially new computers. So the first thing i did was a fresh install of wndows. The product page says this is a 2024 model but the model and serial number are all 2023 according to ASUS. And those are the drivers that are working for me now. other than being mislabeled as newer than it actually is im happy with the laptop.",4
Dariel,Muy buena elecci√≥n,2024-10-10,"Le doy 4 pues la bater√≠a no dura tanto c√≥mo pens√© , para el precio deber√≠a durar m√°s pero una compra muy sensata",4

Julia Wilson,Great!,2024-10-18,It works well for gaming! It does jumpscare you when it turns on though,5
Nina Simone,The (2024) year ad is a false advertisement.,2024-09-09,"The laptop works like a dream. It's snappy, runs well, and runs games well (unless you like 4k high on the most recent releases). It's MOSTLY as advertised, but it's the 2023 model of the Strix G16 and not the 2024 version.",4
Geovanny Limaico,Me encanta,2024-10-15,Es muy bonita creo que fue mi mejor compr√° espero seguirla probando hasta ahora muy satisfecho,5

Michele Schmidt,Works great,2024-10-09,My son is a serious gamer and is happy with this laptop.,5
Tayssir Tlili,Great gaming laptop for beginners as well.,2024-09-09,Great graphics that run games smoothly. Start up does take a minute longer then what I'm used to with previous systems I've owned. Laptop is relatively quiet. Battery life is decent full charge gives about 6hrs if not using it heavily. Fully enjoying it so far.,5
jeff thrasher,a good buy,2024-09-05,"I bought this one to replace my old Zephyrus laptop. The battery life is a solid 8 hours and I'm fortunate enough to a display without any screen bleed. Games run pretty well with high settings and runs cool than I expected, especially with liquid metal on the cpu. The fans are also quiet too. I definitely recommend this laptop.",5

Sanaan Khan,My First ever Laptop it soo good definetly worth it. Only one downside though,2023-11-25,Disclaimer: I am writing this review to avail 90 day warranty extension,4

Chellerbee,"If you're looking for a great laptop, this is it!",2024-04-24,"I had been looking at replacing my old HP laptop for a while now but WOW was this so much more than I expected! My HP played Baldur's Gate 3 at an average of a whopping 7 fps and that was a painful experience. The load times were god awful. The Asus ROG STRIX g16, though, has no trouble running it, even if I push everything to the highest settings possible. I usually get somewhere between 42 fps and 63 fps minimum now during my sessions. The Final Fantasy 14 Dawntrail benchmark also runs beautifully, which I'm very pleased about since the whole point in upgrading my computer was so I met the minimum requirements for Dawntrail when it releases.",5
brad,Great for the price!,2024-09-16,I don‚Äôt know much about computers but I did a little research and I‚Äôm very happy with the purchase,5

Scott,"Good latop, horrible touch pad.",2024-08-21,"Touch pad is garbage. The press only works 20 percent of the time. Usually it pulls up the right click menu, no matter where you press the pad. Every time you type, the cursor is somewhere else, as the pad is positioned right where you rest your hands to type. It's like not a single person at Asus has actually never used this laptop to see if the ergonomics are ok.",3
Carlos J,Recomendado en tiempo y forma,2024-08-26,"Fueron puntuales con la fecha de entrega y el producto lleg√≥ en buen estado, tuve el trackeo todo el tiempo. Fue una buena decisi√≥n de compra.",5
Kindle Customer,ASUS Strix G16 2024,2024-07-20,"This gaming laptop is fast while being compact enough to sit on your lap anywhere. I had it updated, games downloaded and set up in just over 90 minutes (I have several accounts to unlock from non-use). So far, I'm very impressed with it's performance and speed. I have to wait on my wireless mouse and laptop cooling mat before I really get into my gaming mode, but so far it's excellent. The only thing I might add is a bit more RAM and a second SSD storage stick to place pictures and videos on. All in all, as a PC builder, I'm pretty impressed with this gaming machine.",5
Verdot,Best PC at this price point without Diminishing returns.,2024-03-22,"I've been using this Laptop for about a year now, only real negative i have to say about it is there's occasions where the 'Armoury Crate' app( which is the application that controls your fans speeds and RGB lighting) crashes causing the whole laptop to hard crash. It's only happened about six times in total; Bios Updates has made this less common but i think i should mention it regardless. This is the best ""gaming"" laptop on the market for the price. If you want something ""better"" you'll have to cough up a pretty penny going into enthusiast territory; for marginal upgrades with diminishing returns. I've looked around quiet a bit for other computers in this price range, so far this is the best one I've found. If you can get it on sale it's a steal.",5
Carlos Andrade,Excelente!!!,2024-09-01,"Me encant√≥, es perfecta tal y como la esperaba, cumpli√≥ todas mis expectativas.",5
Felipe Castro,Casi la Perfecci√≥n,2023-12-24,"Muy buena port√°til, para jugar es excelente, la pantalla tiene unos buenos colores, iluminaci√≥n decente y una tasa de refresco alta, el sonido est√° bien, a vol√∫menes alto se distorsiona mucho pero tiene un nivel de volumen alto por lo tanto no necesitas llegar al m√°ximos, el touchpad tiene un tama√±o grande y una sensaci√≥n agradable, la construcci√≥n del port√°til tambi√©n est√° muy con una tapa de metal y el cuerpo de un pl√°stico duro, es pesada la port√°til pero es que es de potencia, lo que no me gusta es el teclado, tiene una buena distancia de recorrido pero la sensaci√≥n de los botones se siente barato, adem√°s el grabado de las letras es feo y al encender el computador obligatoriamente el RGB no se puede descativar (de momento no encuentro alguna opci√≥n que me permita desactivarlo). Aunque la port√°til sea para juegos tiene un dise√±o que puede llegar a ser sobrio para entornos profesionales",4
Mohammad Khan,Happy with the purchase so far,2024-09-09,Nice laptop,5
Juliana,Amo,2024-09-01,"Me lleg√≥ antes de tiempo, me encanta",5
Michael Kempton,Had issues but resolved them. Good value for the money.,2023-09-16,"Before we turned on the laptop to test it we upgraded it with the 64 Gb of ram that we needed for 3D scanning. Turned on the laptop and nothing, so we plugged it in thinking the battery might be low which is normally not the case as they have atleast 30% or so from the factory.",4
Phillip,Excellent product,2024-09-02,This product is better than I expected,5

Chris,"A great gaming/all around laptop, not perfect but close to it.",2023-06-02,Rceiving a warranty extension from ASUS for this Review*,5
Laknidu B.,Worth every dime!,2024-01-15,"Three months in using, Right off the bat I personally Got this on black Friday on a massive discount but even without that this laptop really gives you your bang for the buck, it came without even a minor scratch given this was imported from my country in South Asia(good shipping experience) everything so far has just worked except for minor rare crashes here and there while booting games(might be my external hard disk to blame) Runs well, haven't benchmarked it or anything but can assure anyone that if not defective this beast will run anything you throw at it with conveniently playable frames, does weigh quite a lot though( I know duh!) so keep that in my mind, screenns great, rgb has a lot of customization options, the battery is fine for a gaming laptop, really tactile keyboards, material used feels really premium, performance really takes the crown but just know that on extreme setting both on the game and on the armory(native performance control center) things tend to Get real loud real fast, so that is what I have to say about this, am really satisfied with my product and hope you will too( If you decide to buy it), have a nice day and peace be with you.",5
Matt Stafford,Fantastic Laptop,2024-08-22,Great Laptop for the price!,5
Amazon Customer,"This thing is insane, Literaly a pc",2024-08-02,"Insane for gaming, just an example, I‚Äôm able to run Red dead 2 at max graphics with a smooth 100 fps, its been able to run all my games at max",5
Quentin Crews,Great Laptop,2024-03-02,"(Before I start, if you‚Äôre a PC noob like me and didn‚Äôt really know anything starting out, laptops must be plugged in while playing to maximize performance. It will also die very, very quickly if gaming on battery power)",5
Our hustle,Love this,2024-07-04,"The only thing I would change is the part of the keyboard ‚ÄúAsdf,we‚Äôre‚Äù that is neither lit than the rest of keyboard and there is no ten key I would of liked the ten key but the graphics are awesome , easy to use. Stores nicely for on the go light weight . Sound quality is crisp and performance is up to par .",5

Jada S.,Heavy,2024-09-13,Heavy and battery life isn‚Äôt great.,3
Its okay!,The audio üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ,2024-04-25,I know that y pay a cheaper uded version but still i payed 1070 DLL and the fact that the audio doesn't work perfectly its crazy.,4
stereophidelic,Great laptop for a decent price!,2024-01-14,"I've had it for a bit over a month now and it is running like a champ! I ended up upgrading the ram from the installed 16gb to 64GB and it works just fine (thought their website only says it supports 32gb). It also has two m.2 SSD slots so I added a 2TB and it is a beast! I run Cyberpunk 2077 at 1080p Ultra with ray tracing on. I also run Baldur's Gate 3 totally maxed out. Keep in mind that this is more of a desktop replacement at this size and having a GeForce RTX 4060 in it. It should be used on a flat surface for proper cooling and it chews through the battery like it's nothing which is to be expect, but plugged in, it's great. The exhaust is hot, which I did expect. The fan is very quite, which I did not expect. The looks are pretty cool too, not too ridiculous as gaming devices tend to be. I am a very satisfied customer.",5
BRAVE BENK,CALIDAD PRECIO EXCELENTE,2023-12-03,"Vengo de una Gigabyte G5 ke, la cual es m√°s austera, inici√© con esa en el mundo del laptop gaming a pesar de que podr√≠a haberme comprado una mejor y no volver√© a comprar laptops de entrada. Hay mucha diferencia en calidad de construcci√≥n, pantalla, el software de la marca, la duraci√≥n de la bater√≠a, todo mejor. Para mis est√°ndares la calidad de la pantalla es muy buena, la duraci√≥n de la bater√≠a es decente (buena para ser gaming) y lo que m√°s me gust√≥ es lo silenciosa que es (tal vez compar√°ndola que mi anterior laptop). La consegu√≠ en descuento por 1100, por lo qu estoy muy satisfecho.",4
Julio,Amazing product with almost no flaws,2024-03-03,"The only ""could be better"" thing is that all the USBs type A ports are on the right side, which means that if you have a wired usb-a mouse, it can become somewhat of a bother, specially for small tables. That and the optimus. When it switches the display input from the integrated graphics to the 4060 it causes a couple of seconds of screen freeze.",5
PocketPony,Great powerful little gaming laptop,2024-07-22,Great graphics that run games smoothly. Start up does take a minute longer then what I'm used to with previous systems I've owned. Laptop is relatively quiet. Battery life is decent full charge gives about 6hrs if not using it heavily. Fully enjoying it so far.,5
Chimazone Uzor,NOT AS FAST AS EXPECTED,2024-03-02,I had expected that this Asus ROG strix G16 will be faster than my Hp probook 6360b but it is not. The only difference is it has a better gpu which allows extending display.,4
Taha,Minor problems but it's all good,2023-12-09,"The pc came in good conditions, fast shipping with DHL to Morocco, had some minor problems with like it freezes sometimes for 1 sec when I open the wifi section from taskbar, and some minor backlight bleeding that I think its going away now, coil whine started when I first played a game, but its not hearable so that's good. overall its a good PC Value for Money, got it at 1099 usd during the Black Friday sales!",4

Mausferatu,Great but has issues,2023-07-12,"Overall, this laptop is great, and it's already been serving me well, there's just a few problems with it. I've seen this stated elsewhere in reviews and I too have to say that it has rare stuttering issues where a game or other program will freeze suddenly for about a second or two before resuming. It isn't major but it's still an annoyance, and I hope it gets fixed with a software update eventually.",3

Theprime984,"Good laptop, right side speaker is acting odd.",2023-11-04,So at first the screen would freeze and the system had some trouble starting up so i had to restart it a few times and update some drivers especially for the nvidia gpu but now for the most part the system is working fine. The only thing that I have to complain about now is the right speaker will sometimes reduce it out put so most of the sound will come from the left side speaker and I am not sure how to fix that but gaming perfrormace has been great and the keyboard is very nice. Overall a very good device.,4
Amazon Customer,Amazing machine! supercharge your office today!!!,2024-08-12,Amazing speeds display sound everything!!!!,5
Travis Davis Povero,Great computer but mine freezes often,2024-07-09,This computer is great but even as I just try to type this it freezes. Everything else is pretty good for the price. The freezing is livable but annoying. Not sure how to get support aside from shinanaghins with customer support online.,3
Ho Soo Chung,Great gaming laptop,2024-05-27,"More than satisfied with the quality with the price. I sometimes run two games at once without any problems other than maybe noise.

harire,one speaker is not working and screen issues after 3 months of use,2024-04-06,"initially, I was impressed by the design of the laptop then almost instantly started noticing problems with the screen where some parts of the screen became black for a second then it went away and it wasn't a big deal then 3 months later out of nowhere the screen had lines all over it and gets worse over time to the point I can't read the screen I just bought a monitor to keep using it.",2
Vlad,High quality and without defects.,2023-04-07,"Better than I expected and bought it for $1,390. I chose between several brands and studied competitors for about 2 weeks.",5
Charles Garrett,Display failure out of box,2023-11-20,"First the next day delivery didn‚Äôt happen and it was 8pm the following day when this arrived. Outer box and inner ASUS box and packaging were fine. However the display cable or connection to the system board gave me the screen pictured. It powers up and the opening audio plays perfectly but that‚Äôs all I can say. A complete weekend wasted waiting on a new unusable laptop. Very frustrating and becoming more common with Amazon. They just don‚Äôt care anymore. I now have to wait up to 30 days for a refund before I can order a new laptop. I may venture out to brick and mortar stores and I‚Äôm leaning toward not renewing Prime. It‚Äôs gonna go up in price again and continues to go down in value. The laptop looks and feels nice but it‚Äôs useless without a functioning display out of box. Once upon a time, quality control was a thing, but it‚Äôs being phased out to save money and shove products out.",3
Diego,Excelente laptop calidad precio,2023-07-14,"Considero que comprando desde Chile, actualmente esta podr√≠a ser la mejor compra de laptop calidad precio, debido a que en chile, laptops con estas caracter√≠sticas de ultima generaci√≥n, se encuentran muy pocas o a un precio m√°s elevado a comparaci√≥n con lo que encontr√© en Amazon.",5

Tasha Poupee,From Good to Terrible,2024-02-06,"I received the laptop around january and all was going well, i loved the laptop. There were minor bugs but nothing worth wanting to return the laptop. I downloaded Nvidia Control Panel to customize the integrated settings the computer has set automatically. The laptop for its specs was running poorly to the point i had to set all settings to performance and even then it didn‚Äôt feel like a 4060. The laptop‚Äôs performance varied from day to day and i scoured the internet to find out why. When the laptops return date closed the laptop started performing horribly. I‚Äôm talking random spikes of fps from 300 to 60 to 40. Constant stuttering and the wifi getting worse. The laptop is fine for anything but gaming and i feel that‚Äôs pretty ironic. I did buy it for gaming hence it is a gaming laptop. I‚Äôm trying to figure out what i can do to get another of the same model because this model gave out on me and this was NOT advertised in any video i watched regarding the laptop or reviews i‚Äôve seen. I expected to get the best i mean 4060 13th Gen i7-13650HX‚Ä¶ 16 GB of ram there is no excuses for bad performance. I honestly want to hope i just got a bad model because i spend a lot of money just for this to be a great laptop to a disappointing one. I also payed 200$ for a 4 year warranty but the company is making it really hard for me to contact them.",2
Cody,Awesome laptop,2023-10-02,Minus one star because it was stuck in this shipping loop for like 2 1/2 weeks and I was getting no response as the status. Delivery date was moved further and further back.,4
Jamal,Updated: Initial despair lead to overwhelming amazement,2023-11-29,"I initially left a brutally scathing albeit polite review of this product, because on the initial startup it failed to operate correctly and was overall a terrible device. After a hard reset and a week of usage, I am happy to report that it is not only beautiful, but powerful. This laptop can run ANY AAA game on its own, with stunning graphics and amazing framerate. It even recieves my crappy wifi better, so games that used to give me ~180 ping now settle down to a clean 40. When hooked up to an eGPU, it maintains the straight of performance but can run silently as well. I am glad the reset gave me full functionality of this device, it is truly a remarkable piece of technology.",5
kevin nieto m,La mejor PC Gamer,2024-06-09,"Una de las mejores computadoras que he utilizado de las mas r√°pidas y mas eficientes en su uso, no me arrepiento ni un poco por la compra m√°s bien agradezco haberla encontrado",5
Tyler Boulware,Screen has permanent dead lines across it,2024-07-20,The laptop felt OK for the most part and the high refresh display was nice. I did constantly have questions about it dropping keyboard inputs in some games -- something I literally never felt in the same games on my desktop.,2
Parker,Great gaming laptop on the go!,2023-08-05,"I bought this laptop for long work trips where I would have no internet connectivity. Initially I bought the steamdeck from valve. Although I am sure the steamdeck is great for someone people, it just did not have the muscle I needed to play games (I know these two products are massively different price points). This laptop has been great to have as a gaming experience I can rely on! Rocket League is super smooth with two people playing (sorry that is the best benchmark I have)! Would recommend!",5
Carlos,Great laptop,2023-11-30,Didn't want to buy at first cause I thought the 4060 wouldn't be powerful enough but man it runs all my games at max settings no problem. The fans arent even loud while gaming to me it seems really quite with great temps. The only bad thing is mine came with 512gb I will be buying a 4TB ssd later on next year for it. For right now I'm using an external SSD 2tb works very well. I don't think this laptop is heavy as people claim. It's a gaming laptop of course it's going to weigh a bit. If you need a laptop for on the go gaming this is it. I'm very happy with it.,5
Kristin Schott,FYI,2024-07-27,"So I bought this laptop and asus apparently has a really bad issue with the boack screen of death. The only fix is only a temp patch where you shut the computer off, reboot it and hold esc for a few seconds, then press down arrow and enter. The screen will come back on but do any updates that require restart, shut dowm your computer, or let it fall asleep it will black screen so ... If you do buy make sure to set it to never turn off display. When its on amd running its great but the black screen of death issue asus refuses to fix Id say get a different brand.",2
Sebastian,Recomendable,2023-12-28,Muy buena laptop en especial para su precio me lleg√≥ muy bien lo malo es que el material del que est√° echo hac√© que sea f√°cil dejar tus huellas dactilares y es dif√≠cil d quitarlas pero de all√≠ muy buen producto,4
Anthony,"Very dim screen, poor return experience",2023-09-12,"The screen is the downfall of this computer and doesn‚Äôt even justify the price during intel gamer days. Asus claims 300 nits, but this hardly seemed like 250 nits. The rest of the computer is fine but since you buy a laptop for the portability which means you need to use the screeen, this computer fails. Other brands like HP and Lenovo advertise 300 nits or 350 nits in similar priced computers and their screens are usually even brighter than their specifications.",3
Rodrigo Navarrete Recalde,Excelente compra,2023-07-05,"Tenia un asus tuf FX517ZC 2022 y no pens√© que el cambio fuera tan radical, es una de las mejores inversiones que he realizado, 100% recomendado, ahora quiero mencionar todo lo positivo y por lo cual seleccione el ASUS ROG G16 2023, y sus diferentes caracter√≠sticas que voy a describir, -- 1. en juego la temperatura se mantiene bastante estable y el adaptador no se calienta sus ventiladores no se vuelven molestos -- 2. Calidad de sonido cambia mucho y se siente totalmente diferente mas envolvente -- 3. Sus 165hz hacen vivir una experiencia visual mas agradable -- 4. Sus teclas RGB hacen un cambio genial en la experiencia de usuario. -- 5. Su tarjeta 4060 hace que corran con una excelente calidad grafica los juegos que pude probar, y el procesador no supero el 60% de uso, cabe aclarar que esto es mi experiencia personal cambiando de TUF a ROG que me parece muy grande. No duden en hacer el upgrade cuando puedan.",5
Zemlyansky M.,very good laptop for the price,2023-07-14,bought this laptop a month ago and wanna share my experience,5
InScotlandsYard,Started off great but,2024-05-19,"It started doing what it was supposed to and not even a year later the batter completely died. Won‚Äôt charge, won‚Äôt come on at all. So disappointed.",3
