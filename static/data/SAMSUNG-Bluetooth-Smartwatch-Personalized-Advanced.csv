Trinity,"Make the Switch, Apple to Android.",2024-08-01,"Coming from being an apple user and making the switch to android, this watch thus far is superior in almost every way in comparison. From the screen pixelation to sound quality to vibration intensity to superior app integrated. The samsung watch offers a variety of superior features which I think is definitely enticing enough for the switch. Coming from the apple watch it had the basics, the message replies, calls, apple pay, a few mediation and breathing apps, remote phone camera click and an ECG app that never worked. With the Samsung Galaxy watch 6 you're definitely getting better value per buck, you can use Google maps, a semi small but functional google web browser, a watch that measures your stress, gives you a decent review of how you slept from body temperature, heart rate and the cycles of sleep from rem to awake, a customizable watch face, Gmail, YouTube music, various work out apps, fitness and calorie tracking apps, games, a variety of music listening apps, etc. The only necessary cons I would mention about this watch is the voice to text feature isn't quite as consistent or picks up words correctly and the battery life is definitely a little short then my previous apple watch and the band that it comes with for us petite people is horrendous; I had it on the smallest hook and it was still about 3 inches above my wrist and would slide down, thankfully I bought a replacement band that is much better, however I would say for the value, quality and features this the watch to go.",5
SuzyQuzy,I love this watch!,2024-10-16,"I was a Fitbit girl for many years. I didn't like that I only got a year out of each one, the changes in the app, having to pay for the app and I wanted more out of a watch. The size is perfect. I didn't want a bulky one and I was afraid of the bezel one being too big. I use it more for monitoring my steps and activity level then I do as a smartwatch. I like that I can read texts though. I've only had it a few weeks and I love it. I wish the battery was longer and I didn't have to charge it every day. I just have to start remembering to do it when I sit here with my coffee. I love the different watch faces and the custom features. I bought extra watch bands and face covers to protect it. I'm having fun with it I think it was worth the money. Would recommend.",5
Ryn,Best Smart Watch I've had Thus Far,2024-09-21,Got it used and it's in great condition.,5
A. Bombac,"Pretty sweet smartwatch, with caveats",2024-08-18,"I've got a handful of pointers regarding this watch that you might heed before buying it. That being said, I love the thing as of a few months owning it.",4
Pandalox,AMAZING WATCH,2024-10-06,"The Samsung Galaxy Watch6 44mm is a remarkable blend of style, functionality, and advanced technology. Right out of the box, the sleek design catches the eye, with a larger, vibrant display that enhances visibility and user interaction. The watch feels premium on the wrist, thanks to its lightweight yet durable build.",5
jennifer chilton,Great product,2024-10-15,"The watch is nice, it's a great size and has many functions. Easy to work and figure out.",5
Suzette S.,I love this watch EXCEPT for one thing,2024-10-25,"I had a Samsung watch many years ago and I didn't like it at all. The battery life was so bad that it wouldn't make it to 5:00pm without a charge. After that I switched to a fitbit. I had that for many years and it was fine. The face was just scratched up and it was time to replace it. I did a lot of research before choosing this watch. I was a little concerned that as a woman, the 44mm might be too large. That has not been the case. I'm happy I opted for the larger face to get the additional battery life. I can go about 2 days without charging it. However, the charging is the one thing that I do not like about this watch. It charges really slow. I sleep with the watch on and as soon as I get up, I put it on the charger. It typically sits on the charger for about an hour while I'm getting ready for work. It only charges about 40% in that time. I have resorted to getting a charger just for my car so that I can charge it an extra 15 minutes on my commute to work. Other than that, I think I love absolutely everything about it. I am loving the contactless payment. I have having a passcode on my phone, so I never use contactless payments with my phone. The band that came with it is a bit long. I have it on the very last hole. I did purchase a thin adhesive protector for the face, so I can't attest to how easy it is to scratch. Besides the SLOW charging, I absolutely love this watch. And an added bonus that I wasn't aware of when I purchased it is that it will sync with my oculus when I do Supernatural workouts. I don't hesitate to recommend this watch.",5
tracey somsouk,Samsung Watch 6 - Stylish and Functional,2024-09-29,"I recently upgraded to the Samsung Watch 6, finally replacing my old Samsung Gear, and I couldn’t be happier! The design is sleek, modern, and fits perfectly on my wrist. It’s a huge improvement in both style and comfort, making it a great accessory that I can wear all day.",5
dt2008,Software keeps beautiful hardware down,2023-08-24,"I have used two fitness trackers in the past: the Fitbit Charge 2 and the Fitbit Versa 2. I will compare the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 to the Fitbit Versa 2, since it's the only other smartwatch I have used. I tried the watch with two different Samsung Galaxy smartphones: the S22 Ultra and the Z Flip 5.",3
debhibb,Minus 1 star for poor battery life,2024-10-27,"Despite turning the brightness down, and a few other tweaks, I still have to charge this watch EVERY day. If I don't, it will not last through the following day - in particular if you decide to use the GPS function for a hike or run. I'm sure many people simply charge their watch at night, but it's important to me to have a watch that tracks my sleeping patterns, so that's not an option. It takes about an hour to charge in full, so that means it sits on the charger during the day... every day.",4
Matt,Great upgrade from my Samsung Active2 watch.,2024-09-17,"First of all, I love that the media player will now let me rewind and fast forward YouTube rather than just skip to the next video when wearing earbuds. This might sound like an insignificant feature, but it's valuable to me because I can wear earbuds at work, but I'm not allowed to get my phone out of my pocket.",5
Cabinetmaker,A Remarkable Watch,2024-10-18,"I purchased this watch to replace a Fitbit Sense that became defective, on the recommendation of a family member. I am very happy with the purchase! The Galaxy 6 is, in my opinion, far better than the Fitbit it replaced. Some of its features are as follows, but there are many more. The size and design make the watch face easy to read. Notifications and phone calls appear on the watch, and calls can be answered on it. The Fitbit often malfunctioned when answering phone calls; the Galaxy 6 has not malfunctioned. Even when counting footsteps taken, the Galaxy has been accurate as compared with the Fitbit Sense that often indicated that I climbed over 30 flights of stairs each day when I surely did not. The purchase of the Galaxy 6 is a good value for the money spent with all of its features offered. Happy with the purchase!",5
Benjamin,Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic 47mm Bluetooth Smartwatch,2024-08-02,"I've been using the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic 47mm Bluetooth Smartwatch for a few weeks now, and it has exceeded my expectations in several ways. From design to functionality, this smartwatch offers a premium experience.",5
RPC,Great watch,2024-10-21,"I had a 5 and lost it. After a year of searching, I finally got another one. This works well. The battery life doesn't seem to last as long as the 5, oddly enough. But it's not the end of the world to charge it in the evenings when I'm getting ready for bed, so not getting it wet in the shower, for instance. I'm not techy, so I won't get into any of that. It's a good watch and Samsung makes quality products. I'm happy with this 2nd round purchase bought during the last round of Amazon prime days.",5
Human-bot,no external heart rate monitor via Bluetooth was a deal breaker for me,2024-07-25,really wanted to keep this watch as the 40 mm size was perfect and loved the features.,5
Jay,Samsung Galaxy watch 6 review,2024-10-17,Rating: 4.5 stars,4
Robin Lynn Frank,Not Quite Perfect,2024-10-20,"I got this watch primarily for health oriented reasons and it excels at these, especially sleep, heart rate, and SpO2 monitoring. The display is great and the band is comfortable. There are a few things that can be annoying.. For example, customizing from the Wear app on my phone is sometimes unsuccessful, even though those thing work reliably when done on the watch itself.",4
Ana Naranjo,"Muy bonito, practico y completo",2024-10-14,"Es un reloj muy completo, todas las funciones que uno se pueda imaginar. El precio muy bueno pero unos días después de comprarlo salió en los días prime con más descuento todavía, mi impaciencia me jugó una mala pasada porque pude haberme ahorrado otros dolaritos. En cuanto al reloj, es excelente y recomiendo ampliamente que ahorres hasta que tengas con que comprarte un reloj original de Samsung y no inviertas en relojes más económicos que si bien funcionan sin problema (tengo uno de amazon fit y esta perfecto), no tienen todas las funcionalidades de este tipo de relojes.",5
Jim Swaydan,"So far, great.",2024-10-27,"Not being technically inclined, it has a lot that I don't understand.",5
Ewell,Samsung doesn't have FDA approved blood pressure monitoring on this watch,2024-09-24,"I love this watch, it sincs up great with my phone.",4
Desnie Czipka,Love it!,2024-10-19,"I've been wanting one for a long time, and I finally purchased it during the Prime Deal days in October. It's exactly what I wanted. I get the sleep, walking, bp, etc.... information that I needed. It was shipped within a day or so and it came in a large enough box, that it didn't look like a small electronic item. I thought that was to deter porch pirates!",5
Jocelyn,Works well,2024-10-24,"This watch is built well and sound good, I would just get a screen protector and not test the scratch resistance. The notification system works well. I got more than what I was expecting for what I paid for it. It will fit a little awkward at first but it it is good value for the money because of the scratch resistance.",5
Samantha Swanson,Day 1! So far sooooo good,2024-10-09,Only complaint so far is the battery drains SUPER QUICK when you're looking through your apps but other than that it's awesome! I have wanted a smart watch ever since I found out you can text back on them and seeing them on sale I couldn't resist anymore! Looks amazing I tested the typing and while the keyboard is teeny tiny (for obvious reasons) I can still swipe text pretty nicely on it! If I have any big problems I'll update!,4
I have been a fitbit user for many years but I definitely like this Samsung watch 6 way better. I like that I can make and get calls on it and I love all the apps that I can use. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.,Miss Vicki,2024-10-26,I love my Samsung watch 6. I used to wear a fitbit but I like that this watch has the capability to text and make and receive calls. It's lightweight and the price was awesome!,5
Bel B,It's more than a watch!,2024-10-10,"Why didn't I get one of these much sooner? It's great to know how much moving I've done. I also like the reminders to get up and move. I haven't explored everything it can do, but it sure is nice to use this to make calls and receive them when I have no idea where my phone is.",5
Interested,Great for health,2024-10-20,I got my watch a week ago and my experience with it has been great. It's been super helpful with helping my track my health information. I also love the amount of customisation you can do to the watch to make it your own.,5
Stephanie Kennedy,Sleek,2024-10-20,"This is a great quality watch, the notifications are easy to manage, the sound quality is great. I haven't tried the fact that it is waterproof. The wristband is comfortable and is sleek. The value is about average.",5
THawkins,Better than my fitbit!!,2024-09-18,"I am loving the features on this Samsung Watch! I was hesitant to upgrade from my fit bit, but when it died for the 3rd time in 3 years, thought it was time for a change. The only drawback to this watch is the battery does not last nearly as long, but I can deal with that! I love the fitness features, and the ECG that can be done if necessary... I don't need that yet, but could in the future! This watch has been a dream so I hope it lasts longer than my fit bit did!",5
Amazon Customer,Works for me,2024-10-13,"I really like this watch. Easy to manage, works with my phone flawlessly. Lots of watch faces available online for this watch, face for every need. A bit bulky but most all of the smart watches are. Bright face, love the rotating bezel.",4
Gadget Man Forever!,34 hours since full charge and sitting pretty at 54%,2024-09-10,Samsung is such a good company. I bought the 40mm galaxy watch 6 from amazon. But Ihad to send it in for repair to Samsung. They sent me a email saying the watch was not repairable as they would give m e a full refund. Guess what! They did. I will tell you what. If a company gives you your money back if something is not fixable that's a great guarantee and peace of mind. I used the money from that one I got back to pay for the 44m version. It is just wonderful. I really love it and they have great products. Most importantly they stand behind their products 44mm has the bigger battery and you should go for that one. It also makes the touch screen easier.,5
Phillip,Pretty cool,2024-10-25,"Great quality, sounds good, resistant to scratches and has a lot of notifications, fits perfect, it wasn't expensive at all, and I use facer to change watch faces!! I love my watch!",5
T. Thomas,watch is nice,2024-10-04,"It fits well. The face is not too big or too small. The band is made of some rubber substance it is comfortable. I do sleep in it occasionally to get a sleep score. The battery life is only about 2 days, sometimes less when I use it more. I like that I can keep my phone at my desk or on the charging station and I know when I get calls, texts, emails etc. I also like that I am able to change the watch face. Lastly, it does keep accurate time.",5
Sarah,A great watch,2024-08-31,"1st off, get a screen protector before wearing the watch. I did and I am so grateful. I am always doing things and have cracked 2 screen protectors. The watch is completely fine.",5
Young Not Young,Not Easy to Figure Out,2024-08-23,"It's durable, but the silicone band is very sweaty (you can replace with other band types--Amazon has tons to choose from) and it's taking me a long time to figure out. I've also found that it only wants you to use Samsung apps, not Google or others that I use on my phone. For example, I cannot talk-to-text a message and send it to a contact of mine unless I use Samsung Voice, Samsung messaging, and have my contacts saved to my phone using Samsung's phone app. Which I don't use because I find them to be inferior. So that's annoying. It also has all these fitness things I couldn't care less about since I bought this for work. I just think it could be more flexible, more user-friendly, and more customizable.",4
Linda Graul,"Very good, but...",2024-10-02,"When I purchased this watch I thought it could be connected to Verizon, but learned that it was the wrong version of the Samsung Galaxy Watch6 which only connected by Blue-Tooth, so I returned it and purchased the one I wanted. The quality of this watch is excellent and I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't need to connect it to a provider.",5
Nicholas Lindberg,Good but smears,2024-09-19,"First ever smart watch buyer. I use an android phone, so I got this on sale during Prime Day. I like it, except it smears whenever I use the touch screen (drives my OCD crazy) even with freshly washed hands. Nothing a quick wipe on my pants can't fix, but it's annoying to have to keep doing that every so often. I also don't know how accurate the pulse reader is (swings of nearly 60 bpm at rest every other reading). Here's hoping it's the watch and not me lol.",4
April,Better than my Fitbit,2024-10-11,"I have a fitbit however this watch is amazing. I love the EKG which you can download the results and email it to your doctor. It has many functions, and when I call people on the watch they can hear me clearly. I feel like a kid in a candy store.",5
Raul Lozano,Very solid smartwatch,2024-10-12,"I did not rate with 5 stars, as I am disappointed with battery duration and time to charge. It takes a one hour charge every day to keep it working. Compared to a Fitbit Versa I had, that only needed 10 - 15 min per day.",4
Vanessa Truelove,Love love love this watch,2024-10-09,I love this watch and it does all the things I need/want it to do! My only issue with it is that the bevel around the edge is quite thick so having a colored background on your watch face looks kinda funny.,4
Keegan Stall,Reviews,2024-10-09,The watch is amazing and also came with charger (as expected) the only thing is that it didn't come with a block that was compatible with the charger. I only had ones that went with type b chargers not type c. I needed to go buy one to charge the watch.,4
Sandra Phipps,Great watch,2024-09-26,"It was not as advertised and with a manual in your phone you that must be downloaded before installing your watch. It was more of a chores than a pleasure of watches. I ended sending it pack for a $19.99 watch at Walmart which is pretty to look at, easy to read, & no need to install software or updates. Much happier with this one over the expensive one from Samsung.",4
Princhessa,Returning to GalaxyWatch after years of Fitbit,2023-08-16,"Very easy setup if you already have a Samsung account, phone, etc... I literally didn't have to do much at all - registering it online with the SN visible on the back side of the watch was so easy - and seemed to automatically connect with phone. I swear, I blinked and was set up!",5
Teril,Watch loaded with details,2024-07-31,"I bought this watch to work with my samsung phone. It works great! I wanted a watch for fall detection (to keep my sister happy since I live alone); I'm tracking my sleep patterns with my watch; tracking my # of steps & it detects when I start an activity like my afternoon walk. My messages & phone calls come to my watch. I can do pretty much everything on the watch that I can do on my phone. It is so comfortable to wear, that i don't mind sleeping with it on. It comes with the charger, but you will have to buy a C type block to plug the charger into. Overall, it's a great watch but the reason I took 1 star off is that the band is on the tightest setting and it's a little loose on my wrist, so I'll probably need to buy some more adjustable bands. There are also bezel & screen protectors that I plan on buying.",4
AC,A Watch That Nags You and Causes Your Phone to Do Unwanted Things,2024-08-12,"I wanted to track my exercise, heart rate and O2 saturation. I chose this watch because it also gives an approximation of your EKG and estimates your BMI. And I still like the way it gives me a snapshot of my steps, exercise time, and calorie expenditure throughout the day. The readings seem to be fairly accurate. Mileage on the walks matches the AllTrails app within 0.05 mile. pO2 matches the fingertip oximeter at the doctor's office. I like being able to track my activity level through the day.",3
Matt Richard,bezel is best,2024-09-20,"the bezel is so much better than swiping, its a bit heavy but you get used to it after a while. battery lasts me over 2 days WITHOUR doing any of that disable bloatware, turn off adaptive display, etc. it fits well, but i'd double check to make sure you are getting a M/L band and not a S/M one because the bands are pretty small. Display is clean and customizable",4
Katharin Norris,Good deal,2024-10-07,"I snagged this on a super sale, I love the options and wear it all the time. I suggest turning off all unnecessary applications and features you don't use, it'll max out your battery life.",5
Kindle Customer,Galaxy Watch,2024-10-18,I love my watch. I use it to find my phone alot. Wish the battery lasted longer.,5
Junior wickham,Satisfied,2024-10-02,"I was disappointed at first when I saw the size of my screen, I guess I would take the blame, with that said I'm loving the experience with my Samsung smart watch 6",4
Donna Neal,Love it,2024-09-20,"I love this watch so much I bought one for my son and he love it. I wear it every day since I got it. It does everything I need it to do and monitors, my heart rate, pulse and sleeping habits. I have had so many other watches, but this one is the best of them all. It works perfect with my galaxy android phone. I highly recommend it.",5
LBoone5,Very Satisfied,2024-10-06,I had the Gear2 so upgrading to the Galaxy6 was a huge improvement. The phone call clarity is amazing and the overall use is somewhat similar with many updates. I am very glad I made this purchase.,5
Patós,Samsung Smart Watch6,2024-08-17,"Thw watch is is nice, it's light weight and the material used for the band gives it a nice close fit and has a scratch resistant face, which is good if your an active person and do a lot of outdoor activities. I got a black, but there are some other colors but I like to keep it simple and black color blends while with my wardrobe. The watch connects easily to your phone and the process to register your watch online is also quick and just a one time process.",4
R&T,Doesn't Ship with Wall Charging Adapter,2024-10-10,"I just received my Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 and I'm already pretty annoyed and irritated. Nowhere on the product description page does it mention that the watch doesn't ship with a wall adapter for the USB-C charging cable. So out of the box, I can't charge my watch. Had I known the watch wouldn't come with a specialized adapter for charging, I would have ordered one when I ordered the watch. Now, I will have to wait 2 more days for the wall adapter to arrive before I can successfully charge the watch. I haven't evaluated any other features of the watch yet and I will update this review with more or less stars once I figure out how the watch functions. But out of the box, I'm annoyed I don't have all the gear I need to be successful. For a $250 product it feels lazy and cheap that Samsung is nickel and diming customers by neglecting to provide a wall adapter to charge the device AND omitting the fact the device doesn't ship with all necessary components, so you are surprised when you open the box and cannot charge your device. Unfortunate and honestly, unacceptable. It should be clear that the consumer needs to purchase additional components in order for the device to function. Most consumers are not clairvoyant, so I'm not sure how or why I was expected to know this information without it being clearly communicated on the item's description.",3
Tom,Great watch,2024-10-10,"I finally did it, bought a smart watch. Wow this is a great watch. Does more than i expected. Great buy and great price.",5
Dhuddles,Will not connect to iPhone 14,2024-10-25,The watch looked beautiful. I loved the style and look. Wish it would have worked with my iphone,5
dobliv,The Samsung health data,2024-09-01,"After researching the reviews on smart watches it came down to the Samsung watch 6 and the Garmin Vivoactive 5. I chose the 6 because it is more compatible to my Samsung apps. I'm glad I got the Samsung watch 6. It's size is perfect and fits comfortably on my wrist. I sleep with it on for the sleep information and barely know its on my wrist. The battery life could be better but I found that putting it on the charger for a short time, makes it manageable. Love the selection of watch faces! I play a lot of Pickle ball and wear my watch to record the activity. No regrets purchasing this watch. I highly recommend the Samsung watch 6. This watch is as good, if not better, than the watch 7.",5
Shawn V.,"Great product, poor battery life",2024-10-12,"Great product, poor battery life, this is my 2nd Galaxy watch. First was a Galaxy 3. This one does everything I want but the battery life is only 2 days between charges.",4

D-M0NEY,So far its working perfect...,2024-07-28,"I'm sure there's a few watches out there with issues, hence the multiple one-star reviews. No brand is perfect. But mine works great. I bought it when it went on sale after the 7 came out. I couldn't justify the price for the 7 when the 6 is nearly identical. The battery isn't super impressive but it'll last almost 2 days with normal use. But the glass screen is very strong. It's waterproof. Tons of modern features (my last smart watch was an LG from 2014, so this thing is hi-tech AF to me). I'll update to 5 stars if it lasts a few months without issues. I haven't tested the sleep mode yet, I keep forgetting. I always take my watch off before bed. But a watch isn't gonna fix your sleep habits, just tell you that you sleep like shhhhh...",4

I told her to check out the different types of watches and let me know what she wanted. This Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 40mm Bluetooth Smartwatch is what she decided on.

Kendra,Short Battery,2024-07-24,"I love the watch. I went from a fitbit to this. The only issue is the battery just lasts a day. I charged it at 5 last night and it is at 26% the next day at 11 am. I don't want to be charging it all the time. I track my sleep with it at night to charge is not an option. So during the day randomly I have to charge it. It also takes way longer than my versa to charge. I see that as really the only down fall of this. Honestly, it would have to be 100% charge in the morning to even last the whole day. And I'd you charge while you get ready in the morning it takes more than an hour to charge. Bummer.",4

Angela Scott,Good watch,2024-09-19,Only complaint is that you cannot take your blood pressure with this watch. They imply you can (which you can). They imply you can but ypu cannot in the USA as it does not have FDA approval. You can do heart rate and ekg. Most other things work great.,5
Lou,"Battery length, and the variety of watch faces",2024-09-03,This watch is so much more accurate than my 4 and I love all of the face customizable choices I get. The charge lasts over three days instead of one and the fit is great. I bought it for an amazing price and it tracks my sleep much better than my old one. It even tracks temperature. I love the look with thee band I chose I hope it lasts for a very long time.,5
S.J.,Nice watch,2024-08-28,"I got this to monitor my sleep patterns, but it didn't seem to work. Turns out it's because I wasn't really sleeping. Now that I have a cpap machine it tracks my sleep just fine",4
Gennaro,OVERALL WATCH,2024-09-22,"Great watch. Functions are useful, looks very nice, but can you please do something about the battery . Costly watch for this battery challenge",4

Green Blue,Best smart watch I've owned,2024-09-03,"My Samsung Active 2 died after about four years, and I liked it so much that I decided to get another Samsung smart watch. This one is so much better, lots of new features but still familiar. I use it most for messages, health monitoring, and controlling my music on Spotify. I saw the some people complained about battery life, but mine is great. I charge it every other day, which I think is reasonable.",5
Alina Castaneda,Big Watch,2024-09-14,"I like the watch it fits my needs. I use for it steps, but also it keeps the heart rate, bmi, etc. It's a big, I'm a small woman and I like big the larger watches. The battery life is the only negative if I were to say anything. Not a big deal I just charge it. About 2 days prior to recharging.",5

Christina A,Galaxy watch,2024-08-20,"This is my first smart watch. I've been putting off getting a smart watch because I didn't like how big the face was. When I was looking online I didn't realize that it was geared more towards being used for health reasons. Which is actually fine with me. I love that it connects to my phone very quickly. The screen isn't huge and it's easy for me to read. I bought this on Amazon Prime Day so I got a great deal for it. I did go and buy different watch bands. I didn't want a plain one. I wish the battery lasted longer. I'm not a huge fan of charging it once a day. Other than that, I really like this smart watch and glad I finally bought one.",5
yankeemama,Battery life sucks!,2024-07-03,"I chose a Samsung watch because I have other Samsung products, TV, phone and tablet, and all are great. I had hoped this would be too. The watch is nice, easy to set up and use, but the battery has to be charged every day. I have been charging it off my tablet because I was not aware the charger plate did not come with it. That is something that should be stressed in the description. At least I have a means of charging until I can get one. I don't use most of the apps and still the battery is low by bedtime, so has to be charged again. The watch is good for a senior like me, easy to read and who won't be doing a ton of stuff on their watch like a younger person. I can't imagine the battery if used a lot during the day for apps. A good watch? It serves it's purpose for my needs, so yes. A great watch? Absolutely not until they can do something about the battery life.",4
Lindsey Brow,Love it!,2024-09-15,The 40mm is perfect for a small size wrist. Use it to track my activity throughout the day and running pace for the 5ks. Seems to be pretty durable and no issues when it has gotten rained on.,5
