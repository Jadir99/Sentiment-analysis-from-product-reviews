Zach,Great ultrawide monitor if you can get it under $400,2024-07-15,"Overall I'm a lot happier with this than an old 4k tv from walmart. Only complaints I have were the lackluster HDR, which I expected only being HDR10, and the color, which was a super easy fix. I just changed was color, I changed it to Cool 2 and set blue to 70 and it looks perfect now. No dead pixels or cracks to speak of, just some scratches on the frame from being a clutz installing it.",5
Asten,"Great quality product, but be careful with the curvature amount on non-ultrawide",2024-09-11,"Definitely just not for me, returned it, this was my first time trying out a curved monitor. If you're used to a 32"" flat screen I would probably recommend staying away from 1000R curvature, the problem is 1000R is a VERY tight circle (1000mm Radius), and this is a normal ratio screen, 16:9, which means the curve is just way too strong for such a small screen, especially for a first-timer like myself. A 45"" 32:9 ultrawide monitor handles a curve much better in my experience. And definitely don't get a curved monitor if you have OTHER monitors that are not curved, it creates a weird imbalance looking back and forth between them, and I would imagine all of the 'eye relief' from the curved monitor would be lost by adjusting back and forth. Also on the 32:9 even a 1500R is much better and more subtle. 1000R is just a really strong curve and keep that in mind if you're thinking about trying this screen out. I would probably recommend a 32"" 1500R first to ease into it. Other than the curvature, the monitor is awesome, great definition, 2K res is beautiful, the colors and sharpness is all perfect (though you can adjust it anyway ofc), the refresh is very smooth, and the stand is too tall like most monitors.",5
Rafael Ramirez,"Great monitor, bad calibration",2024-09-02,"I bought this monitor after looking trough a lot of research and comparations, in the end i decided for this one due to its price and spec, almost a blind buy since i couldn't find any other reviews outside the amazon website, but i have to say im very happy with it.",4
Angel Lambertt,A product to boost your productivity as a software developer,2024-08-30,"As a software developer, I’m always looking for tools that boost my productivity, and the Samsung 27-Inch Odyssey G55C Curved Monitor has been a game-changer. The 1000R curvature helps me stay focused and reduces eye strain during long coding sessions. The QHD resolution provides sharp, clear text and plenty of screen real estate for multitasking with multiple windows. The 165Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time ensure smooth scrolling and responsiveness, which is great for working with complex applications. HDR10 support makes colors more vibrant, which is useful for reviewing design elements and debugging graphical issues. Overall, this monitor has significantly enhanced my workflow and comfort. Highly recommended for developers looking to upgrade their setup.",5
Jackson,Best. Monitor. Ever.,2024-08-16,I personally am a casual player and don’t need an extremely large monitor to do that. But this monitor is a must have. It has a perfect curve and is built with tech that makes it as good as a TV. I not only outshines all my other monitors with its tech but also with its graphics! The graphics make my gameplay 100% better and it is truly great. The monitor turns on instantly. It is sooo easy to connect to my console or pc. This monitor works great with my console and my pc and can switch between them with a click of a button. This is truly my monitor for the next 5 years and I highly recommend it.,5
RadiantBuyer,Solid upgrade,2024-09-19,"I ran 4K 60hz monitors for my at home business. Also gaming on same setup, the graphics and frame dropping was garbo. So I ditched 4 monitors for 1 monitor and just split screen it. Beautiful gaming experience now. Great refresh rate. And to think, I used to be tech savy. Falling so far behind, I feel freaking old. Still remember working on dual CRTs. Glad to catch up a little",5
Greysil Mutterbottom,"Image isn't bad, cost cutting is",2024-05-31,"The image quality itself is really good for a VA panel (black smearing still exists, obviously), but the cost cutting shows, and there are a few odd quirks of the monitor.",3
Brian,3070 DP Triple Monitor Setup,2024-10-18,I almost did not buy these there were so many mixed reviews. I spent days searching reviews. My hopes are the buyers with flickering screens had a bad cable or maybe a faulty graphics card port. Just a guess. I can’t explain anyone else's experience. So far so good for me. I bought three 32”. Pre-mounted setup as I am still waiting for the triple arm mount. I have a fourth Samsung G5 32” thats supposed to be higher quality with LED 3000:1 contrast ratio and they all look the same though that one is not in this picture. Hope you jumped on $200 each for prime day. ^^,5
OUCAST,It's okay,2024-10-07,It a good looking monitor on some games but on others I can see some sort of blur to the picture . No 120hz if your on ps5 it doesn't support hdmi 2.1 only 2.0 it but quick delivery only took one day . The stand also doesn't really move or tilt . I will move on to another monitor as soon as I can still a great monitor though I'm just nitpicking on thing I'm catching,4
Joel,Recibido en Argentina sin problemas!,2024-10-14,Pedí el Monitor con dudas de si iba a llegar y lo recibí antes de lo esperado!,4
Erick,Exceeded my expectations a bit,2024-10-17,"I'm a neewbie joining the pc gaming world. And i must say for what its worth, this is like the perfect size for multitasking and to game. Crisp quality video, and the overal set ip to get up and running was simple too.",5
BrewBabe,"Make sure its compatible with your system, investigate G-sync vs Free Sync",2024-07-10,"Great Monitor when you read the specs, however, my laptop that I am using is a Acer Predator Helios 16 which uses NVidia G Synch. The Samsung uses AMDs Free Sync technology. The two do not play well together. While the monitor has a 165 hz refresh rate, the best you'll get when its plugged into the Acer Predator NVidia Graphics card is 99hz. By the time I figured it out it was past the refund date. I don't necessarily blame the seller, its just something I wasn't knowledgeable enough to be aware of. With an AMD system it would work great without a doubt. I'll most likely buy another monitor that is compatible with the NVIDIA graphics card, and resell this one on marketplace.",4
Makaira Fumiko,Impressive fr,2024-10-08,"Even when it's a 2k monitor, I was able to play it in 4k on ps5.",5
Lulu,Video,2024-10-10,Been using them for over a month and I’d have to say they look great color and resolution is nice and the settings are easy to use with the button on the bottom.,5
Carlos G.,✨Reseña desde Colombia✨☕ Un monitor caaasi perfecto.,2024-04-27,"Tengo presente cierta dificultad para realizar esta reseña, pero la encuentro necesaria.",4
Robert Henderson,bought an open box item very happy with purchase,2024-09-06,"Bought open box item, not a single scratch or defect on it and got it about 50 dollars cheaper i guess i just got lucky. One thing its an IPS monitor and the blacks are a little more grey but doesnt bother me. This is a more all around monitor for graphic design along with any gaming you want to do and its responding great. I made sure to go with Samsung because i dont want to buy chinese products no matter how cheap or easy to get and samsung has a great track record of quality.",5
Aces&8s,Works great but….,2024-09-14,"…the screen can be damaged very easily. I ruined one already. It was totally MY fault but, be very careful moving this monitor.",4
Jeremy S.,"Original arrived visibly broken; Ordered replacement - Good quality, screen flicker",2024-06-29,Product arrived with severe visible damage to the screen. Box it was shipped in didn't appear to have any damage. Refund requested.,4
TheTrampingPony,Needs a DP for 165Hz,2024-09-15,"Very nice screen, but if you want 165Hz refresh rate, you'll need a Display Port cable.",4
Juanca,monitor muy bueno,2024-10-14,excelente imagen por su reputación en monitores en la gama media alta,5
Anael C.,large and impressive,2024-10-12,for the discounts this screen gets...somtimes its for 199$ it is a very good buy.,5
Johnny,Should be 5+ but,2024-04-01,"Like the title says, this should be a 5* but speakers are dead. I don’t use the monitor speakers but they should work and I had to take a star away for that.",4
Gustavo,Excelwnte producto,2024-09-17,Me parecio genial el producto. Muy puntual y la verdad llego 2 dias antes de lo esperado. Solo diria que deberia traer la placa de atras para poderlo poner en la pared y/o almenos las dimensiones de los tornillos tambien. De resto genial excelente producto,5
Valeria M.,Great monitor with one personal flaw...,2024-08-12,"First of all, I love this monitor! The 32 inch screen is a great size for gaming & movies, as well as using it for your PC. The colors are vivid and the 1440p/2K resolution rate is still top notch. The refresh rate is very smooth as well. I also like the ""eye comfort"" feature it has to block the blue colors so you don't strain your vision. And lastly the customization for different screen filters is great! But my one qualm, which doesn't affect my rating for it, is that I wish there was a handheld remote for the monitor itself rather than pushing the buttons from the center bottom. It can be a bit difficult to change the settings so a lil remote would be a cool addition for future monitors. But that's it, everything else about this monitor is great!",5
Derek Zalme,Deluxe monitor,2024-08-30,"Wasn't sure what to expect with this monitor but once I took it outta the box I was impressed with it's design and structure. The curved aspect is nice and the size is plenty big for whatever your preference is whether you're gaming, working, data conversion or even watching movies or video conferencing. The resolution is immaculate, what you'd expect from samsung quality and does not disappoint. The G5 odyssey is the way to roll for any new computer system.",5
Eric Bickerdyke,"Huge monitors, absolutely beautiful display",2024-08-21,"Fantastic size, and an absolutely beautiful screen. I never realized how smooth 155 hz feels, but don't think I can ever go back. Take note before ordering these though that the stand to hold these are almost as large as the monitors themselves, and actually stick out a bit more than the screen - I didn't take that into account, and now need to take it off my monitor stand to stabilize it. Still, fantastic purchase, couldn't be happier for the price I paid.",5
dragnet,Perfect!,2024-10-06,Love this monitor!,5
Andrés Felipe,Bigger and more curved than I thought,2024-09-02,"Wow, it was more curved and bigger than I thought. But not bad. I love its resolution and the refresh rate is incredible. Arrived in Colombia in 10 days in perfect condition. Now I’m thinking of changing tables because the monitor is huge.",5

sugarshrm,You need a good computer If you are planning on running 165hz,2024-07-26,"Overall the monitor is great for normal use, you can comfortably use 165hz on normal desktop use. But, if you plan on gaming and you normally reach 60-75fps normally. 165hz will look horrible while gaming, especially in power hungry games.",4
Diane,Great monitors. Alittle surprised they did not have built in speakers,2024-09-08,Arrived quickly and easy to set up and sumsung support is excellent. I had a couple questions and was able to chat with a real person almost immediately. Highly recommend Samsung and also these monitors,5
Alive and Well,Limited height adjustment,2024-07-19,Beautiful graphics. A very nice jump from a 1080p on a 3060; will be interesting to see how it does on a 4080.,3
BJ,"Great monitor, terrible source switching",2024-06-23,"The monitor itself looks great and has an amazing picture. However, when one source turns off, it fails to switch to the other source that is on and connected. Every monitor I've owned before this one has done that automatically. However, this monitor will only switch to a new source when it turns ON. Also, for some reason, windows on my second window move to the primary window when resuming from sleep. All-in-all, great monitor.",4
Dean,Great monitor with a few exceptions,2023-10-15,First off I was initially very impressed with the size and image quality of this monitor. I had this on my wishlist for a while and when it went on sale for under $350 I couldn’t pass up the chance to buy it. However after using it for a few days there were two things that bothered me in my usage. First was the fact that you can’t really adjust the height or the angle of the screen. I found it to be rather low when sitting on my desk and despite its size I’m used to having monitors that sit higher. It also had a tendency to seem to lean forward a bit (maybe it seemed that way from being so low and would have been tolerable if it was higher). The next feature (or lack thereof) is the fact that there are no built in speakers. I don’t expect high quality sound from built in speakers but every monitor I’ve had in the last 10 years had built in speakers and at $300+ the fact that they didn’t include bothers me. Maybe that won’t bother some people but it would have been nice to know before purchasing. Conversely I decided to buy another monitor made by LG that has similar specs and was cheaper and (in my opinion) is much better value than this. I decided to buy the Lg monitor after my Samsung one suffered an unfortunate accident where the screen cracked. Thankfully I was able to contact Amazon and they were very understanding. I explained what happened and they explained they could offer me a refund and gave me a return label to send it back since it was within the return window.,4
olleybear,"Onboard speakers dont work, annoying popping sound coming from them",2024-07-29,Pros: Its big and has a beautiful picture. Comes with a DP cable. Very light monitor. Bought on sale.,3
John wilson,Great monitor,2024-07-26,"This monitor looks and performs fantastically. I had a 27"" G5 Odyssey that I bought in 2021, and that thing was a tank. It survived multiple drops and still performed like new. My only problem with it was that it was slightly too small for my liking.",5
Gonzo,Decent at best,2024-10-08,"The picture quality is not what you’d expect from a 1440p monitor in my opinion. I have three 1080p IPS Asus monitors that provide a much clearer picture and better color. The refresh rate is nice. I’ve paired this monitor with an NVIDIA 3080 and overall I’m not sure I’d buy it again given the option. Also, this monitor does not have onboard speakers which I did not realize upon purchase.",3
tyler galarza,Pretty Mid,2024-06-01,"Little disappointed with this Samsung monitor. I just assumed it would be a top tier product but this monitor is just the average gaming monitor with Ultrawide aspect ratio. Which is fine with the price of $350, but if you want a true monitor upgrade I would go all out and get a OLED, which will fix every issue I have with this monitor i.e. Ghosting, Color. But if you just want a big screen for casual gaming and watching videos this monitor will certainly work for you.",4
Jason,Amazing Monitor for Gaming!,2024-09-11,"I use this for my Xbox Series X - Refresh Rate, Resolution and Response Speeds are all impeccable. No complaints what so ever!",5
Tom,"Ah, large multiple screens",2024-08-21,"What a delight to have large multiple screens as I work from home. No, I am not a gamer, but the flexibility is greater with the 34"" curved monitor than a standard separate flat monitor. I was up and running as soon as I plugged the HDMI cable into my doggle.",5
Riddick DJ,Never buying Samsung monitors again,2024-09-30,"I had a really bad experience with this monitor. The only reason I leave 2 stars is because of the quality of the image, which is really good.",2

Alex,Curved screen is the best,2024-08-15,"I’m really impressed with this monitor! I’ve been using it daily since October 2023. The stand’s quality is average, but that’s only noticeable during assembly. I’m using it with a 3090 Super graphics card, and the system automatically set the refresh rate to 165Hz. The smoothness is remarkable, especially in games, and I can now comfortably work with two windows open at the same time.",5
Eric W,WHERE DO I START,2024-05-06,"I had a G5 early model back when it was a 32"" monitor. Loved it, the size was perfect and it was just the best for gaming and music production. Lots of space. However, human nature has to ruin everything. As embarrassing as it is to admit, one night I got killed in a way that sent me just a little bit too much and I punched probably the most expensive option that I had, the monitor. Completely broke it in multiple ways, the only part of the monitor that worked was the lowest left corner. Great. Just broke my $350 monitor. OK, let's check Amazon and just get another one. $550????? I didn't feel too good about my emotions at that point but hey, work was good and it looked like they upped the size and hz from the previous G5. Boy did they ever. This thing is incredible. The curve and size might be a little to adjust to but once you game on this thing you'll never feel normal playing anything on a flat monitor. It's so much smoother (165hz vs 144), it fills your entire vision, it's just the ultimate experience for anything, from Counter Strike to Forza. Don't even bother to check BenQ, just do yourself a favor and buy this. Samsung killed it with the 32"" but knocked it out of the PARK with the 34.",5
Tony Armida,Absolutely the best,2024-08-17,"This is the first Samsung I have owned; the stand is a very light weight plastic, but durable and strong enough to hold the monitor.",5
Julia Burns,great monitor,2024-08-17,"I use this for gaming and it’s huge. almost too big but that’s only because I sit so close to it lol. easy to put together and set up, great, clear, fast and detailed picture. turns on and off with my xbox so I really do like it.",5

Atyoukha,Immersive Gaming Experience,2024-08-16,"The Samsung 34"" Odyssey G5 Ultra-Wide Gaming Monitor offers an impressive gaming experience with its 1000R curved screen and 165Hz refresh rate. The ultra-wide aspect ratio and immersive curve pull you into the action, making it ideal for intense gaming sessions. The monitor's performance, particularly in fast-paced games, is commendable, with smooth visuals and minimal motion blur.",3
Adam Culley,Insanely Good,2024-03-13,Let me start this review by saying: I’ve been a PC gamer for my entire life. I’ve used all types of different monitors… but I finally decided to purchase my first ultrawide monitor just recently. Best decision I’ve ever made.,5
VT,Love this monitor,2024-07-27,"Keep in mind, there are no built in speakers on this monitor. I personally like built in speakers because the sound is low enough that I don’t disturb those around me for background noise. I can easily switch to AUX or headphones if I want great sound. Anyhow I use my Mac Studio built ins. Otherwise it is a great monitor for the price. Nice picture quality, perfect size/resolution/color for my creative apps. The monitor itself looks sleek",5
Mike C.,Terrific!,2024-03-14,"This 34"" Samsung monitor replaces a 34"" HP monitor I've had for years. If the Samsung lasts as long as the HP did (now on another PC), I'll be quite happy. I was hesitant after reading negative reviews, but so far, this seems like a very good purchase, particularly because it is much MORE expensive everywhere but Amazon.",5

Only issue I had is when the product came in, the display port cord was suppose to come with was missing and I had to worry if the port was going to be defective or not. Luckily Amazon customer support was able to help me with this and I was able to get a cord and test it out and the port was in working condition. Refresh rate was advertise and going from 60hz monitor to 144/165 I can see amazing results.",4
Noah,No complaints,2024-08-11,Great monitor no complaints. Built in speakers work well with my other speakers with a sub. Great picture for the cost in my opinion. I’ve had monitors that cause more didn’t come with built in speakers.,5

Gavin Sanchez,Great 1440p monitor,2024-03-04,"I got this used like new for half the price, and it looked like it wasn't used at all. The monitor itself has been great as a main display for gaming and multitasking. The 34 inch screen doesn't feel overwhelming like the larger ultrawides. The only issue I have is it being a VA panel, so there is some ghosting. I also can't get freesync to work without flickering, which is more of a driver problem and not the monitor. I would recommend getting your own monitor stand, as the one it comes with isn't the best.",4

When it arrived, I found out that it was missing a USB-C port in 2024, and lacked speakers. I get a ""Setup Guide"" message displayed each time I plug it in, telling me to change the refresh rate from 60Hz to 180Hz. The thing is, I can't with my hardware setup, which means it's going to bug me each time.",3

CDRMBung,It's BIG!,2024-06-29,"So I went from the display built into my laptop (2560x1600, 16"") to this (G55C, 2560x1440, 32"") monitor... whoa... my previous external monitor was an old Samsung 4K 28"" panel (U28E590D) from 2015 or so. Please pay attention to the measurements, the 32"" panel is huge. It's like a TV on my desk!",5
Jordan S. C. Thompson,Poor design,2024-02-08,"The design for the hookups was poorly thought out and executed. The cord that comes with it for display port gets kinked, stressing the display port jack severely, to the point that there is static lines that appear occasionally from a bad connection. Only solved by reseating the connection in the back. Needs to come with a L bracket for display port, or a proper cord. The monitor will likely be broken soon at this rate.",4
joseph becker,Lines flickering across screen.,2023-09-07,"I ended up buying 3 of these from Amazon. Each one ended up having flickering lines across the display. Sometimes it would be fine for a few hours, but always came back. It was most noticeable on the menu screens, but started happening during game play. The first one I called Samsung and they told me the serial # was not correct and wanted me to supply pictures of the lines. Since I only had it a few days, I returned it and ordered another. The second one worked fine for a few days until I would no longer show a display. The PC would recognize it as if it was working, but the display was black. I returned that one and tried a 3rd monitor. That one also had lines, so I tried to get it taken care of through warranty. I REALLY wanted this monitor to work well as it was very nice when it was not malfunctioning. After spending 30 minutes on the phone, they said they could possibly repair it and I would have to send it out. They also advised that I may just want to return it. I ended up getting a different brand as I am not convinced that any other monitors of this model would do the same thing. Again, I really liked this monitor and I really wanted it to just work. I tried swapping cables, ports, power cables, drivers",3
Cat,VA panel,2023-06-03,"I had a really difficult time finding any reviews about this monitor. That being said, I decided to buy it anyways. First off the screen is a VA panel, so the blacks are pretty decent. The drawbacks are that there is some visual smearing with fast movement. I bought the flat version, not the curved model. The refresh rate is up to 165 hz. Honestly it looks good to me, the image is nice and sharp, and my games play well. The monitor base/stand is super adjustable and I’m trying to decide if I even feel like using it with a monitor arm. It says it’s hdr compatible… however based on the color specs it really doesn’t do well. I’d recommend not turning on hdr, it looks washed out. Overall I like this monitor, and it’s my first 1440 p monitor. If you are super competitive in fps/esports titles you probably already know that an ips panel may serve you better than a va panel for less smearing during fast action.",4
Honest Abe,Amazing monitor significantly Exceeded my expectations,2023-02-10,"I will say anyone who gets this and wants 165 hz from a laptop to buy one of those cables from Amazon USB-C to display port that supports 166 Hz. there’s a humongous difference between 165 Hz and 100 or HDMI. This monitor is kinda like an entry-level sports car. It may not have all the bells and whistles, but it’s got insane torque, horsepower and the diskless brakes. I Think this could last as a five year monitor.",5
Jaymes,Good value + Quality,2024-01-22,"Monitor is not dim like many reviews state. It is bright, but definitely struggles with white bleed. Monitor also suffers from a lot of screen tearing (AMD freesync wont work with my Nvidia card no matter what I try). Overall though, as a gaming monitor it does seem to go up to 165hz at 4k resolution in length and 2k in height. For less than 400$ it was a great value buy.",4

John W,165Hz@1440p w/FreeSync,2024-07-11,"More pixels and a higher refresh rate than my LG 34"" Ultrawide 1080p 144Hz. FreeSync is icing on the cake, but important if you're a PC gamer using an AMD video card. The price was right too.",5
Jerrett Cox,Absolutely beautiful display,2024-06-06,"I bought the Samsung Odyssey G4 34 inch monitor back in March. This monitor is absolutely amazing. The picture quality is perfect! I do have a question though... I bought it used-like new, and it is in pristine condition, but it didn't come with the screw that secures the base to the neck. What it the best way to get a replacement screw? Thanks in advance!!",5
Josh,Only lasted a little over 1.5 years,2024-07-17,I loved this monitor when it was working.,2
Philip Treacy,Monitor,2024-08-14,Nice monitor,5
Wood d,Works great,2024-07-30,I was worrying about Samsung monitor’s’ infamous “dark-screen” issue. But so far so good.,5
Felix Perez,It's Good,2023-10-15,So far from using a normal TV is has been great using a monitor and the curvness really does make it feel better when playing. One thing i have nticed is when playing or simply watching something if it isndark and the camera movesbor pans somewhere quickly you will notice some where light moving behind or with the object when the camera is moving. I'm not entirely sure how to describe but it is something I've never seen with my old TV. Also Brightness is low but simply adjusting it will make it look Great.,4
