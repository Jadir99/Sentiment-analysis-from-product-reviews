Roddy R Rosario,REVIEW WITH THE MOST IMPORTANT INFO OF THIS XBOX CONTROLLER!!,2024-07-21,"Good packaging, it wrinkled a little because I used Amazon prime with free shipping.",5
Riva Iron Grip,Works great on PCs just like it's predecessors!,2024-10-10,The “core” controller is the latest iteration of the xbox controller and from a quick glance it can be difficult to spot a difference from the xbox one controller but there are some subtle ones.,5
B. Billy,"No Issues, Works Great",2024-09-16,"Had to replace my Red Xbox controller because its drifting now (I know I can replace the little joystick, and thats coming soon). I got this because the price was right, cheaper than picking up at the store. Works great, it's not a knock off, it came in genuine MS Xbox packaging, and connected to my Xbox Series 1 with no issues, and I have been using it for about a month now.",5
Austin,Much Nicer than the Older Xbox One Controllers,2024-10-14,"I decided to finally replace my old Xbox One controller that I've had since 2017. I've replaced so many parts in that controller over the years, when the triggers started sticking (due to the foam bumper pad behind the triggers having worn out) I decided to just buy a new, updated controller.",5
Greg Stone,A Top-Notch Controller with a Stunning Design,2024-08-24,"The Xbox Wireless Controller in Electric Volt is simply outstanding! The vibrant color is a real eye-catcher, and the build quality is top-notch. The new hybrid D-pad feels incredibly responsive and precise, making it perfect for all types of games.",5
Wriddler,"Works and is as advertised, but slightly confused.",2024-10-04,"I didn't take pictures, because I didnt think much of it at first but I am a little confused. While everything works perfectly fine and has no issues, there were some confusing and random things for it being a new product. When i opened it, it looked like the box had been opened, repackaged (poorly) and than retaped back up. There was also some damage to the box. When i opened the box, the packaging looked like it was either out of order or reboxed improperly. The cabling wasn't coiled or anything it was randomly stuffed in the box, there was one random scratch on the controller (not very noticeable) and it was covered in dust and hair. That was the most confusing part of it being new, covered in dust and hair.",4
R34P3RX13,It's legit,2024-07-12,"Having been an Xbox owner for 20 years (xbox original, 360, 360 elite, xbox one halo edition and xbox series x) I have always loved the xbox controller, especially the original big boy that shipped with the 2002 xbox systems. It just fits my hands perfectly and over the years they just seem to get better.",5
3N☆°,Yummy blueberry rose vapor,2024-07-04,"This wireless Xbox x|s controller revolutionized my daily gaming experience. I can now enjoy my favorite mobile and PC games wirelessly and without cramping my hands on the touch screen or keyboard. I can now play with comfort, ease and full control. No more looking for buttons or keys to execute commands. It's what I missed most about console and handheld gaming.",5
Tommy,Great Bluetooth Controller,2024-10-18,"So I thought that the entire controller would be the color that you pick. Well no just the face of the controller is, the back is white. No big deal, I should’ve looked at ALL the pictures. Purchased this because my other controller generic brand RiotPWR Left Stick started acting up after 3 weeks!!!!",5
parker,Thumb Grips for Xbox Controller: 1-Star Review,2024-09-18,Xbox Controller: 5-Star Review,5
Crewtonn,BEST FEELING CONTROLLER,2024-09-26,"This is so awesome! One of the best controllers I have used, usually when you get a clear controller the plastic is not as protective can feel cheap but this feels great. the grip on the back of the controller makes it feel premium! The color and style of the control is sleek, you can still see the controller rumble from inside but it doesn't make it feel like a little Kids controller. I suggest this controller to anyone, it has good weight to it like an xbox controller usually does. The price is great for the product, if you want to go on and make your own controller on Xbox Lab do it but you won't get this color way unless you do a elite controller for double the price! Great job xbox and amazon for getting it to me in 2 days and making me excited to play my ROG ally with a controller again!",5
Doug,I go with these,2024-10-04,"What can I say about these nice Micfrosoft Xbox controllers. They are of the best and these colors are enjoyable. You know that kind of color that excites you when you see it? However, the build quality on these controllers is not of the best. The controller looks and feels like a quality controller, but I find that they last about 6 months before something stops working on them. Like on my last controller, the right bumper button went flat like it lost its spring. Fortunately, these Xbox controllers cost less than the Playstation or Nintendo Brand controllers. Still, I give Xbox 5 stars because all of these controllers break just the same so... why not spend less money on a nice feeling controller with exciting colors. I use this controller for PC gaming (Steam).",5
Ashtitan,Love the red color,2024-10-15,"I had a blue controller where the rubber on the left stick was torn and came iff. I had some replacement sticks, but the controler was several years old. I decided to buy a new one. Looking at the options; I didn't want pink, white, nlack ir another blue. I decided to ho with red. The order arrived a day early on Sunday and I couldn't be happier. It has textured grips, I hate rubberized grips. The stucks and buttons are responsive and it has a comforable feel. I will definately look at this seller if I need more accessories.",5
Lenny,Purchase it on sale for $42,2024-10-04,Purchase the green on sale for $42 within the first week there were stick drift probably just a fluke they are made in mass production send it back reorder the blue one for $40 and got the red one for 40 as well. Can't be that price for brand new series X controller love the red and blue. Easily returned if you have a card on file they will send you a new one before you even send the one back you have 30 days to send it back or they will charge you for the new one definitely recommend just keep watching the prices fluctuate every few days,5
Usayed,Xbox Core Wireless Gaming Controller – Carbon Black Review,2024-07-24,"The Xbox Core Wireless Gaming Controller in Carbon Black is a fantastic addition to any gamer’s arsenal. This controller isn't just about looks—though it does sport a sleek, modern design—but it's also about functionality and comfort. Here’s why it stands out.",5

Tanvir Salahuddin,Nostalgia manifest,2024-10-16,"For those who miss the clear shell fad from the early 2000's, definitely pick this up. Reminds me of a simpler time in my life, and the interesting design language in electronics.",5
Bohdan Mashtaler,I like color and quality,2024-08-28,"I ordered new controllers, but received used one, and without original box. Wait a week for delivery, ow need to spend time to return this controller and wait for new one. Controller is good, but seller is worst!",4

Laszlo Alberto Donaire Bonilla,Muy comodo,2024-10-11,"Me agrado su peso, la sensación, es bastante cómodo en general y cumple lo que promete y se ha sentido la calidad en el tiempo corto tiempo que lo he usado la parte de los agarras son un plus muy bueno no lo recomendaría para juegos de peleas por que vas a querer cuidarlo y que dure",5

Keanu G.,Perfect Controller…Questionable Mailing,2024-10-12,"I bought this controller and it seems to be working perfectly so far, but when it was being mailed it had been delayed and the packaging was beat up.

allyson,Perfect and from the ACTUAL xbox store,2024-10-10,"It can be tough to find genuine Xbox controllers on the website. I ordered from the official Xbox store, and the packaging was great. It even came with two Duracell batteries! Plus, it arrived really quickly. Highly recommend!",5
Pitt Prof,Nice Controller!,2024-10-10,"Bought this because the one that came with the XBOX was starting to act a bit wonky. Got it a bit under the going rate and have had zero issues. The color makes it easy to spot, too!",5
Serg,A huge upgrade for my PC gaming,2024-08-26,"I purchased the Velocity Green XBox controller because the 360 one I had been using for years on to play on my PC was finally giving out. What a huge improvement. Battery lasts a decent amount of time, but between my battery charger, it's really had to tell - and swapping the batteries is so easy, it doesn't really phase me. I've used it on my Samsung Frame as well, and it plays Gamepass on the TV with no noticeable lag. I'm very happy with this controller, and I don't need any of the fancy stuff the elite has. I just wish MS added a few more features to the controller like the DS5's adaptive triggers. But beyond that, the colors the best part.",4

Daniel Garcia,Good once you're comfortable with it,2024-09-22,"Everything in the quality of this controller is sound. My games run smooth, it works with c-type wires from other xbox controllers, and I love the responsiveness of everything. I only have a personal issue with the grip on the bottom. It was meant to help my hold on the controller but it feels like it makes my hands warmer than im used to. Other than that its a great fit for my build.",4

MartyQ,"Solid & the standard, but...",2024-08-11,"Solid & the standard, but if you want to use this wirelessly with your Win10 PC, you may have trouble. It may work with Win11, but it did not work with my Win10 setup. I see online that MS warns about this & suggest you use a USB cable or their wireless USB adapter. USB cable did work. Also, I purchased a generic xbox-compatible wireless USB adapter & that worked well; but it was disappointing to pay $$ for a genuine MS Xbox controller, only to find it does not work with my Win10 PC. Since Win10 support is ending, unlikely MS will fix this.",4

SKent,Replacement,2024-09-20,"Old ones wore out. Like the color on this one. Connected fine. Almost seems a little slower on the react.

Matthew,Looks great,2024-09-25,Looks great. I have bought 2 because I really like the gold and black look. I got one for both my pc and labtop. The only issue and the reason for 4 stars is it took a week or a little longer to get.,4

Chris Howard,Good for Big Hands - But Batteries? Really?,2024-09-02,"This is a good controller. It's what windows expects, so setup was a breeze. Native support in all the games I play (mostly racing and platformers). D-pad is good for the classics despite the shape. Satisfyingly click-y buttons. Ergonomics are good for this big guy with big hands. Recommend getting a rechargeable battery pack, batteries are so 2005. It should come with a rechargeable battery pack, otherwise no complaints.",4

Tim McGrath,"Don't go for cheap junk, buy quality!",2024-08-09,"I've bought several ""no name"" brand controllers, and every single one breaks within the first few months. I finally decided to grab an Xbox controller for my PC and this thing is clutch. The design is superior. The feel is superior. You can just feel the quality. The longest lasting controller I have was from my Xbox One, and it lasted alllll these years. This one is 100% a quality improvement over the last, but that only makes sense, since it lasted me literally 10+ years!! I can tell this controller is going to last. I love the feel. So happy with the upgrade.",5

Por otro lado las baterías son unas Duracell no recargables lo que me parece muy mezquino de parte de la compañía no poner baterías recargables considerando que es algo que se espera de este tipo de productos, por lo demas esta ok",4
