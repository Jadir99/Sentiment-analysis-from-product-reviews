Kelli,Read carefully *Revised Customer Service A+,2023-04-07,"* After writing this review, the Amazon store representative, Freya reached out to me, to see if they could resolve this issue. They not only respectfully listened to my concerns but quickly changed the description for future purchasers. Overall, the product works well and is quality for the purchase price. Customer support is a game changer though. I will shop from this store again, solely because of the positive response.",5
Susanna Castro,Great quality!,2024-09-24,"I recently purchased these for my computer and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with the decision. The sound quality is outstanding, providing clear audio for both music and calls. The microphone picks up my voice perfectly, making it great for meetings and online gaming. Additionally, the comfort level is excellent; I can wear it for hours without discomfort. Overall, this headset has significantly enhanced my computer experience, and I highly recommend it to anyone in need of a reliable and comfortable audio solution.",5

xtreme elite gaming,What's the most important to me in this case with the headset would be quality of sound.,2024-08-28,"I recently purchased the Bengoo G9000 gaming stereo headsets, and while they look great, I found the sound quality to be underwhelming. The volume is too low for my taste, and unfortunately, there‚Äôs no adjustment switch to boost it. I also noticed that the bass is quite lacking, which takes away from the overall listening experience. If you're looking for something with deep bass and more powerful sound, these might not be the best option. They do have a decent design and are comfortable to wear, but the audio performance just didn‚Äôt meet my expectations.",3
Chris Snyder,GREAT budget friendly headset!,2024-09-15,"My headset randomly stopped giving me audio last night, so I over night ordered these! And they fit amazing, the Audio is great on both PS5 and my PC. Highly recommend for the value.",5
loktai,These are cheap.... But for the price? Pretty good.,2023-09-01,"Maybe these are geared toward smaller people or kids but though the head band is more than big enough- fits fine, the ear phones are really more on-ear than ""over-ear"" and do press on and touch my ears and hurt after some time ... Ive gotten used to it . I dont really use these for gaming I have nicer ones for that but I could use them for that and it would work. The microphone seems to work well and I use it for that. I am on a lot of webex meetings and VOIP phone calls and stuff with the headset and its MUCH better than like a mono headset in terms of using it for audio the rest of the time. It has a volume adjustment on the headset itself which works fine. The microphone swings up and down and its a little stiff but works fine- it doesnt mute itself when tilted up as far as I know, maybe it does but If so it doesnt have any kind of indication it does , markings, or audio cues to let you know the way my corsair and others do.- again- PRICE. The audio quality is about a 6-10... maybe a 7-10. depending on your tastes with a 1 being a mono headset with 0 bass and a 10 being like a pair of Sennheiser 400 dollar headphones - so dont take 6 as that much of an insult its serviceable but it isnt a ""premium"" feeling audio. You wont feel like youre listening to a tin can or something. For general use its fine.",5
joan151,Great Budget Headset for the kid who keeps breaking his,2024-09-09,"Works better than the ones found in ROSS or other knock off outlets. They adjust without easily breaking. Kid loves the camo color. Not wireless so no need to wory about battery life. They look good and comfortable, not hat big not that small to carry around.",4
richard torres ariza,La mejor opci√≥n para clases online,2024-09-28,"Desde que comenc√© a usar estos auriculares para mis clases online, he notado una gran diferencia. Como docente de programaci√≥n para ni√±os, necesito un equipo que ofrezca buena calidad de sonido y comodidad, y estos auriculares cumplen con creces.",5
Vale la pena por su precio. Y el armando es muy f√°cil mi esposa las arm√≥ ella sola. De verdad que este producto vale la pena. Y la entrega s√∫per r√°pida.,M√°s o menos.,2024-10-19,Mi hijo los usa y le gusta. El √∫nico detalle que noble di cuenta es que no tiene para apagar el micro. Del t√±resto todo va muy bidentro.,4
Chris,Looks great and feels great.,2024-10-17,They are exactly what was described as. They are comfortable and have a long cord which i liked.,4
Cody Bennett,I mean it‚Äôs a great mic dont get me wrong.,2024-09-25,My only issue and this is probably just me. My previous headset brought the mic closer to my face and I could actually tell that people I was talking to can hear me. It‚Äôs a good headset I just prefer a mic on it that‚Äôs closer to your face,4
juan galvan,They do what they‚Äôre intended to,2024-10-09,"They work decently, but the earpiece and the headpiece looks like it‚Äôs dirty, even though it‚Äôs not, and the wire seems to bind up",4

Rashidi,Bought in 2022 and still no issues !!!,2024-07-31,Like title says I purchased this in 2022. I take care of my stuff but there are no shortages or issues with this headset. The only thing I noticed I would say to generally improve the product is if your in a room that is hot (global warming) the ear muffs get warm and uncomfortable around your ear.,4
