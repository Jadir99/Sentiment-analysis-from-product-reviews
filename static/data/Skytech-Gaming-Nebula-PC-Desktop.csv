Mel,Easy to use & Easy to setup,2024-02-19,***There Was No Compensation For This Review****,5
Mark,Good pc for the price surprised not going to lie,2024-08-21,Ordered this PC from a store called MXC tech because it was on sale it turned out that place was a scam (MAKE SURE TO ORDER IF IT IS SHIPPED AND SOLD BY AMAZON.COM),5
Tayllor Burkhart,WOW!,2024-09-10,"I am so impressed by this PC. It is my first pre-built gaming PC so I was pretty nervous about purchasing one from Amazon. I made sure the seller was through Amazon specifically, because any other seller than Amazon or Skytech themselves is a SCAM. Be cautious and always check the seller. My computer came with a mouse and keyboard, which I find to be decent quality. The keyboard doesn't have those loud clicky keys, instead they are fairly soft. The mouse I am unsure about, as I haven't used it. It seems cheap and other reviews have stated it broke or turned off after a bit. So far, the keyboard has taken a decent beating playing certain games and has held up pretty well.",5

Micah Cowan,Ridiculously good value,2023-12-27,"(I got the model with a 4060 in it.) I mean, what is there to say? A 4060, a 1TB SSD, 16G RAM and a decent CPU? For under $900?! I didn't really have money for a gaming PC, but when I saw this deal I had to make it work, because who doesn't want to save like $1k!",5
Allison M.,"Nice computer, amazing tech support",2024-06-16,"The computer ran amazingly but for some reason, the one I got had a messed up fan speed control. I talked to tech support and they actually knew what they were doing. He found the problem and I was able to send my pc back and get a new one within a week of first buying it",4
Shayne Davis,Great starter PC,2024-09-17,"Out the gate I ordered additional RAM, I am adding more hard drives to it now as I use it primarily for photography which takes up a lot of space. It runs great, boots super fast, looks great and even when running serious programs and pushing it near its limits, it still stays cool. The fans are super efficient and comes with a program that makes it to where I can speed up/boost the fans as needed as well.",5
Just Theo,Love it!,2024-04-03,"I definitely recommend this desktop. It arrived sooner than it was supposed to. It is very quiet. Seriously I thought it was dead on arrival because it was so quiet I was convinced it was not powering on. I could see the lights and the fans were moving, but couldn’t hear that hard drive sound, and fans were quieter than a cotton ball dropping on the ground. I have a brand new monitor and it was saying no signal. I had plugged the monitor into the wrong HDMI port. Once I figured that out, I could see that the computer was working lol.",5
Trevor,Happy with my purchase!,2024-09-11,"I've had my PC for over 2 months now and haven't had any issues. Everything came packed well, the case it came in is nice enough and I don't plan on upgrading it anytime soon. The PC did come with a questionable PSU, a Gamdias brand PSU which isn't a reputable brand, but from what I found online the PSU will perform fine and I'd imagine you'll be okay with leaving it in there for a good long while until you can upgrade it. I do recommend upgrading the PSU eventually, only of course if your PC comes with a PSU from a non reputable brand. I'd imagine they just grab whatever PSU they have that matches the promised specs so brands likely aren't going to be uniform. That is the only part so far I've upgraded as all the other components were from good brands. Everything has performed well and overall I'm very pleased with my purchase. It even came with a mouse and keyboard which certainly are cheap products but they are perfectly fine if you can't immediately buy a better quality keyboard and mouse. I'd definitely recommend this company for pre-builts as, from my experience and what I've read online, they do a pretty good job and their quality control is solid.",5
ThomasFMC,Awesome value - kid loves it.,2024-09-07,"This is a terrific deal -- powerful configuration with lots of room for DIY upgrades if needed. Came well packed with a high end gaming video card, a decent processor, and Windows 11 Pro (easy to upgrade to Pro, if you want to spend a small amount) and padding inside the case to keep the internal components secure when shipped. My 15-year-old got this for his birthday and it's a great improvement over his old machine - no problem at all to play his favorite games on Steam and Epic Games. I added 16Gb of extra memory for around $30 on Amazon (using same brand) but other than that it had everything we needed. You'd spend about the same money or maybe even a bit more to build this from scratch so it's a no brainer to buy it pre-assembled. Overall, I highly recommend this product.",5
Iziah,AMAZING!!,2024-08-27,"I am not a bot. I have morals and beliefs. I've crapped myself in a walmart before. Everything I'm saying is 100%. This computer is amazing for the price it's honestly unbelievable. I don't have to worry about running a single game. To clarify I can't run everything on max graphics but it's pretty close. Every game I've held over 100fps constant. Reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the RGB lights don't turn on with the pc and you'll have to manually turn it on with the application pre installed for it. It's not a bad issue, it's just irritating. But anyways if you're thinking about getting this pc, do it. I don't regret it one bit. One thing to add it was packaged very well. No scratches or cracks on anything.",4
James Donlon,Excellent performance and so well shipped,2024-10-08,"This computer did NOT disappoint. Quality components, well built, and when I put the new rig through benchmarks it delivered! It is handling my most demanding sessions of X4 Foundations without a hitch! Also, the computer was more carefully packed and documented than any I have ever ordered. Kudos for that extra care!",5

Chris robbins,First couple days in,2024-08-04,At the time of writing ive had it for 2 days and have put 12 hours between 4 games first one is American Truck sim which doesn’t take much to run obviously computers overkill for it 2nd was satisfactory and its solid it lags around high density areas but to be expected its not a $5k pc 3rd was mw3 and ran it no problems a little lag here and there but once again to be expected 4th was GTA5 and same as the other 3 ran solid definitely bogged down a couple times but was quick to get back to normal overall worth the money very very easy to setup clear instructions on the website the only reason for a 4 star is mine wasn't wifi enabled which no problem as im right next to my router but could be a downside for someone who isnt,4
William Gillikin,Awesome PC!,2024-06-12,"Ok, so keep in mind I’ve only had this PC for about a week. Should anything change I’ll update my review. With that said, let me just say, WOW! I recently wanted to get back into PC gaming and didn’t really feel like building a PC myself, so, I decided to go the pre-built route instead. And boy am I happy with that decision. First off let’s go over the main components of this budget beast.",5
ROM,AMAZING!,2024-09-06,"13 days with this PC so far. And it's perfect. Can run just about anything on high settings. LOVE that you can customize the L.E.Ds and you can even turn em off super easy with the SignalRGB Software which was a pet peeve of my old PC. I spent $1,822.18 on my old pc this i spent $911.61 on and it performs WAAAAAAAAAAY better.",5
James Coffman,"i5 13400F, RTX 4060 - Little less than expected as a seasoned computer tech",2024-04-07,"This isn’t a terrible purchase as the parts are definitely amazing for any title out right now. I will start with the bad though. I got the PC out of the box and removed the packing inside and while getting ready to setup I had a 2 TB m.2 that I was immediately adding as expansion. There is no standoffs available for expansion. There is also no spare SATA cables or anything else that you would get as part of a new motherboard. The one that really got me, it’s a WiFi motherboard but the antennas were not with the computer, anywhere! There was also no power cable as stated there would be, luckily I have plenty of those lying around.",4
april,Worth every penny!,2024-08-22,"I bought this computer for my son and its amazing! It's fast, very quiet and his games don't lag anymore like his old computer. This computer already has wifi in it, but it also came with 2 screw in wifi antennas for extra boost. Without the antennas my son only had 2 internet bars, but we screwed the antennas on and it went to full bars. My son said he doesn't know how to act, with a computer that runs so smoothly. It came also with a folder containing certificates of when it was built and all the testing they did on it, to make sure everything ran perfect before sending it out to us. I would definitely buy this again! I have nothing bad to say about this pc.",5
nickens11520,Really good pc,2024-10-02,"Came put together quite well, just had to correct one thing on motherboard. Otherwise runs and functions as advertised.",4
CydL,Amazing PC for the price,2024-09-02,!! WILL UPDATE IF ANYTHING CHANGES !!,5

Samuel,Exceeded My Expectations,2024-07-27,"I was a little wary of buying a prebuilt PC off of Amazon, but I’m so glad I did! This PC is so much better than I initially thought it was going to be! It has been able to handle every game I’ve tried playing so far on high or greater graphics settings with ease. I’ve even been able to play VR games like Skyrim VR with zero issues!",5
Bimco,Good Value,2024-10-04,Everything works as advertised at a good price.,5
Be,Best experience I’ve had in gaming.,2024-10-02,"Really nice computer, runs almost every game above 144 fps with mid-high settings on almost every major gaming title. Unboxing was smooth but be careful when taking out the styrofoam packaging inside the system. Comes with mouse and keyboard which I have been using frequently. Everything was plugged in such as the GPU cables but make sure to check anyway. This pc comes with dual band WiFi antennas (WiFi wont work without them. I would really recommend this pc for whoever is contemplating on buying. I was also skeptical price seemed too good to be true but it’s worth every dollar.",5

Matt,"Works great, they gave me a higher wattage PSU than advertised.",2024-08-21,"Easy to setup and appears to be working flawlessly. 2 year warranty on parts is very nice too (+1 year for registration). They actually gave me a 650W PSU (50W more than advertised) so that combined with a 2 year warranty for parts, and no issues during setup + some gaming makes it really hard for me to wrute a poor review.",5
Andrew,For the price this is excellent.,2024-08-11,"I normally build my PCs, but picked this up for $699. With the parts supplied and the OS, this was a very decent deal. Got a ASRock B760M-C motherboard and a Gigabyte 4600 with decent ram. Runs quiet at 27C. Just put in 32gb of DDR4 Corsair ram and it rebooted fine. WiFi works as it should. Plays Kenshi well, but don’t really have any graphically intense games. Appears well built. Just bought a second Nvme M2 for games - mine had two m2 slots. Overall, this looks a great deal for what I paid.",5
Good keyboard but customization color,Delivery issues,2024-07-24,"My first ever prebuilt, made me feel so happy. You get a mother with a built in wifi and a 4060! Hopefully this lasts months and the only issue was the shipping. I requested to be delivered it on sunday but couldnt since business close so they just redeliver it after 2 days thank god I kept contacting customer service I thought it was lost but nevermind very nice pc",4

Caligurl254,It's really an fantastic computer,2024-07-31,"This really has been a fantastic computer the last couple of months. I wanted to make sure of it before leaving a review. I've been running games at max graphics and have been doing some basic video editing and it just runs so wonderfully and smoothly. As for now, the fans have not kicked on but the website says they'll only come on when needed and so far, they just haven't been needed. I definitely recommend this computer if you want to do some gaming, if you want to record said game recording and do some video editing. It's amazing!",5
Isaiah,great pc for beginners,2024-08-15,"everything about this pc is great! Only thing to keep in mind is that if you plan on streaming with this or using multiple programs/apps/games at once your going to need to upgrade your ram, luckily you can get another 16gb of ram for around 30-40$ which is enough for the average gamer. overall if your buying your first pc this is the one to get. Happy gaming!",5
Elaine,Amazing for a starting gaming computer (Nebula),2024-06-10,"My son is in love with Nebula PC. He's being dreaming for a Gaming computer for 2 years. After using a regular Notebook which drives him crazy with lagging while playing Fortnite. He was amazed when he opened the box. It looks beautiful, He opened the glass and admired all the pieces (I'm not a tech person). He started the computer and could not stop thanking me for this purchase. Regular setup time, about 2hrs including updated and Fortnite download. He could not believe when he started to play and got 150FPS (he was struggling with 60FPS on his laptop). He kept saying ""It does't lag mom, this PC is a beast!"" :) He is happy and I'm happy. Hopefully it will last a while. I'm not a tech person, but me and him we have researched a lot to find a good gaming computer below $1,000. After reading all the reviews for a starting computer I think we choose the right one! (I was very concerned with shipping, but it came faster, and so well packed!)",5

Ethan,Great for the price,2024-08-13,Tested out this PC for its limits ran many games highest setting in 4k and kind of at a loss of words for 800$ you get a pc that can run games amazingly at very high settings always got over 60fps if you play high settings in 1080 I always saw over 100fps. Great PC for the price.,5

Med8r,Great rig for the money,2024-04-21,"I was hesitant to buy a prebuilt PC, considering the many examples I've seen of shoddy work. But I'm glad I took the chance on this one. Evidently Skytech is of a different caliber from the other guys, because my tower came well-packaged, in pristine shape, and with a better power supply than was advertised.",5
James C. Waters,All I’d hoped for!,2024-08-19,I was nervous about purchasing a prebuilt gaming computer but I am so happy with this Skytech Gaming Nebula! I’ve only had it a month now but have had no problems with it and it runs my games perfectly.,5

Ash,Bad delivery,2024-09-05,"Bought this computer as my very first computer, i got it, it turned on worked great until a download then during the download it gave me a blue screen and restarted after that restart it continuously froze upon restart then stopped showing any display period. I called Sky tech and they said it might’ve been too dinged up in delivery and wasn’t working properly after having me take a few pieces apart and put them back together. I will be ordering the same PC again to see if the issue was the delivery or the computer in general. Other than this problem it was very beautiful, and very quiet. The lights are amazing and you can change how the lights act",3
Pro-Freedom,*6 MONTH UPDATED REVIEW*,2024-06-02,"So after 6 months of hard use I still give it 5 stars. I have had no issues with this pc. I have pushed it with the most demanding games I have. GtaV, RDR2, even Silent Hill 2 remake. Always runs with high graphic settings and decent framerate with the exception of Silent Hill 2 remake that only holds at 30fps but I have seen beefier builds struggle with the same game.",5
tcharles2255,Beat expectations!,2024-05-03,"Every decently well optimized AAA title plays at 100-144 fps at 1080p on high/ultra settings. Takes quite a bit for frames to drop and even when they do it’s never below 60. Temps look great and cable management is very nicely done. Only complaint is the cpu cooler rgb’s stay rainbow because it’s plugged into the cpu fan header with nothing plugged into the argb header. Called customer support on skytechgaming.com and they said that’s just the way it has to be even thought the cpu cooler can be changed through software. Small complaint nonetheless, other than that definitely recommended!",4
Gilbert,Very good PC for the price,2024-08-09,I bought this pc about 3 days ago I’ve played Fortnite,5
Kenny May,Amazing for the price!,2024-02-04,"Overall, this pc is amazing for beginners into the pc gaming world. I mostly play minecraft, and it runs 200+ mods with shaders with 150-200+ fps. It worked right out the box without having to plug anything in besides of course, the power cable, monitor, keyboard and mouse. As for the keyboard and mouse, the mouse feels cheap but gets the job done, but I was actually quite impressed by the quality of the keyboard considering its a membrane keyboard, however the spacebar is super loud. Now, for the rgb of the pc itself, it's very bright, colorful, and you can customize it with the software preinstalled. And I know most pcs nowadays have bluetooth, but I was worried that this one would not, but it does have bluetooth! So you don't have to worry about buying anything extra like an adapter. Overall, great machine, totally recommend if you are wanting to get into pc gaming.",4
Travis S,Good rig for the price,2024-03-18,"This is the first pre-built system I've purchased in almost 20 years, I've always built my own. On to computer... Keep in mind, I'm not a heavy gamer... At first, the fans were running full blast all the time. I couldn't see the RPM in the BIOS to adjust them, I re-seated the one cable that runs to the fan controller on the motherboard, booted it back up and there it was. I don't know if it wasn't seated properly or just ""one of those things"" but it fixed the issue and I was able to adjust them. All good now.",5
Jahid,good for its price,2024-08-23,Got it for my cousin and he liked it,5

Marie,Skytech service was great,2024-04-29,I purchased a used one. One of the side panels was kind of dinged in like somebody from shipping sat on. I reached out to amazon and they offered to give me a refund. But it would take About a month. I reached out the sky tech and showed them the receipts and they are sending me a new side panel.,4
Pcxpert,Things to know about pc,2024-09-06,"This PC is really good but, they are going to cut corners somehow in my case it was the PSU. Had it for a month and quit on me out of nowhere the gave me a Helios p1 650W which is a $30 PSU. so be aware of the parts you receive because you might need to upgrade.",3
Leo M.,"Parts quality, price, secure packaging",2024-07-19,"Appreciate how they used name brand parts for the pc build. Great price, packaging was awesome and overly secured! Got it at prime deal which is a steal. Everything works well and had an extra year warranty with a signup on their website.",5
Bad pour of the outer layer,Surprised to say the least,2024-03-13,"I ordered 2 of these, one for the wife and the other for me. Gaming wise these are great, quality is great, shipping packaging was knocked around dented and torn but the inner shock insulation did its job. No dents in the case, all the corners are square. After removing the packaging and checking for loose connections I didn't find anything out of place on either side of the board.",5
Skoobz,impressed,2024-01-07,"Never heard of the brand and wouldn't normally buy a gaming pc off of amazon. However, I am quite impressed with the purchase. the build quality is pretty good considering the price. they used some quality components. had a Gigabyte mb and Asus power unit. comes packaged pretty well for shipment and includes a folder with the qa testers that i can call and complain about if the unit fails down the road but so far, so good. has enough fans to keep it relatively quiet under load and comes with a skytech branded generic Chinese mouse and keyboard, which i didn't need. the keyboard was the membrane kind, yech! if you're looking for a decently priced gaming pc with good build quality and good components, you can't go wrong with this one.",4
Dean A. Yoder,Great Computer for A Great Price,2024-07-25,"So far, this PC has been awesome. I got it on Prime Day for a great price, but even at the normal list price, you can't beat it. If you are looking for a very good machine at a budget price, buy this one.",5

She's very happy with it - she chose it. So glad I get to reward all her hard work.

Nicholas nowak,Buy It!,2024-08-12,The best quality and most affordable PC on the market. The performance is unimaginable.,5
Users,Sloppy packing inside the case - DAMAGED MB connection. Returning.,2024-02-09,Skytech crammed so much packaging material INSIDE the case that they smashed the D_LED1 RGB connection hard enough that they broke off one of the pins inside the connection and badly bent the other 3 pins. Check out some of the YouTube videos of the Nebula unpacking and you'll see how they pack it. There was too much material and somebody just smashed it in there so that they could get the cover on. But then they put it inside a shipping box the was too big and didn't pack anything around it - so it was loose inside the box.,3

Ryan Glickfeld,wifi problems,2024-01-06,"This pc is amazing for the price but I will say this, you definitely will need to buy a separate wifi adapter. This pc comes with a super crappy wifi adapter that gets a max of 10 ish mbps of download speed and usually stays in the 3-5 mbps range. My old pc used to easily get 50+ mbps, so I know it’s not my wifi thats the problem. I tried to fix this frustrating problem, but nothing seems to work. Be prepared to spend 15-20 bucks on a wifi adapter, if you wanna play online games on wifi.",4

Absolutely amazing but did already order a 4070 super to replace the 4060. 4060 will be enough for most doing normal gaming but i sim race in titles like acc that take a bit of power to do nicely. The 4070 super in thus build will do me perfectly! But for 850 getting this build in general even with the 4060 runs amazing.,5

Centrifikal,Good for 1080p gaming,2023-12-14,I bought this rig for my son. I was going to build my own and then came across this on sale. It is not a bad deal for the components. The motherboard and GPU brand I got was Gigabyte. The Memory and SSD were T Force. Those would not be my first choices for hardware but I know you can't choose what brand you want with these pre-built computers. I had to go into the bios and fine-tune the case fans and change sensor location as they were pretty loud out of the box. The expanding foam is secure for shipment but you have to cut the stuff out of the tower or you can risk bending parts trying to remove it otherwise. Other than that I am pretty pleased with this purchase. It is a good rig for 1080 p gaming. Plays most games on ultra 1080p near 60 fps.,5
