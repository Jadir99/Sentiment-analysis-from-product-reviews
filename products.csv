Adriana,Very good mouse for the price,2023-12-24,"I was looking for a breathable type mouth for a while and i could not afford the other expensive ones so i wanted to give this one a try, ive been gaming with it and its super nice, it feels like really good quality and its also very pretty looking! Its DPI settings are super easy and super fast as well and the colors are nice too. I would reccomend if youre looking for a pretty/nice looking mouse that has the same functions as a much more expensive one for a low price! :))",5
Gabriel Coigny,One of the best value mice,2023-03-21,To be honest I didn‚Äôt expect this mouse to be anything special when it only costed around $21. I‚Äôve got to say this mouse is definitely one of the best bang for your buck.,5
Jake Griffin,Great for the money!,2024-04-16,Does the job and looks nice!,4
Anthony,Incredible,2024-03-30,"My pc off, but lemme tell you im not a mouse a keyboard player so this more for show, but the mouse is absolutely incredible for trying m&k for the first time, colors on the mouse too are fire highly recommend dont be sleep on these inexpensive products",5
Hailey,Pretty large but works so amazingly,2024-04-11,It‚Äôs pretty easy to setup and it‚Äôs so comfortable and light. The wide variants for the colors are well appreciated. It works just as good and probably better than a $100 mouse. Worth every dollar,5
Edward dixon,Fantastic mouse,2024-07-04,"I don‚Äôt use this mouse super often, as it‚Äôs not part of my main PC setup. But I very much like the honeycomb design as well as the feel of the mouse itself. It‚Äôs comfy, even for hours on end working from home. Would highly recommend. Plus my lady enjoys the pink color quite a bit, so that‚Äôs a bonus!",5
Desire,Mouse,2024-09-09,My son purchased this and loves the fact it lights up,5
Perfect,Mouse starts spamming out,2024-06-17,"I‚Äôve had this mouse now for about 1 month & 3 weeks. The led lights start flashing non stop, I‚Äôve downloaded the app for the led and it won‚Äôt stop flickering. Mouse is light keeps my hand cool most of the time, Works perfect besides the led lights. Not hard to turn them off at all.",3
Alberto,Lightweight and comfortable to use,2024-07-15,"I'm really impressed with the DIERYA M1SE Gaming Mouse. The honeycomb shell design keeps it super lightweight and comfortable, which is great for those marathon gaming sessions. The 12800DPI sensor is spot-on for precise tracking, and I love being able to customize macros and RGB settings‚Äîit adds a personal touch to my setup. Overall, it's a solid pick for gamers who want performance and style in one package.",4
Justin,"NIce mouse, goofy lights",2024-03-16,"I enjoy this mouse, but I wish, wish, wish the instructions were better. It does change patterns (if you want to have a seizure I'm sure they'll be great). I didn't get it for the light patterns, I got it for the changeable light but it doesn't seem to change to a color I want. It just has one default color for constant on.",4
DECEMBER,Great for DAW use.,2023-09-01,I hate Ableton Live because you have to use Ctrl+scroll type combinations to zoom and such. My mouse failed so I got this because of the extra assignable buttons. The software download is easy to use to assign any keyboard keys to any buttons. And you can create macros.,4
Dayli,It‚Äôs good,2024-05-01,"It‚Äôs good but the only thing for me it‚Äôs I don‚Äôt know why move to the right, when I play valo",4
Kristen Wolfe,"Great mouse, I got when it was in sale",2024-04-03,"The normal price in my opinion is not worth it, because the mouse is plastic with holes around it and some RGB lights, just get a cheaper (gaming) mouse and you should be good. But on sale, this is worth it.",4
a guy,It's a good mouse,2024-04-07,"As I said it's a good mouse with the value for the money! Only complaint is that the side button does build up gunk, but it's not a big problem just cleaning it off.",4
Summer,"It‚Äôs good for the money, but it could be better",2024-05-29,Helpful,4
Jack,Got it as a gift,2024-04-13,I got it as a gift for my little brother. He uses it all the time and loves it.,4
Teresa Barron,Gaming mouse,2024-04-15,Bought this for my grandson he seems to like it and works fine for him,4
Juan Gonzalez,LED's Stopped Working,2023-10-15,"Ordered it back in April of this year (2023). Got delivered fairly quick and the box it came in came in good condition. Took it straight out the box and the mouse itself was in good condition as well. Hooked it up to my Xbox and worked right away. Response time was good, surface area of the mouse felt good for my hand size, and LED display was cool as well. But just recently did the LED's go out. The only light that worked was the red one under the mouse for the sensor. The other different color LED's no longer turned on but the mouse still works the same although the LED's don't work.",4
Lauren,Not bad,2024-03-18,I personally like the mouse for gaming and the light up colors. I've had to replace it once so for the money its not bad.,4
Miranda Miller,Great for gaming,2024-02-26,"My previous mouse (which was wireless) would ""go to sleep"" during long periods without clicking (ie running around in a game without performing actions) which caused me some issues. So I thought I'd try this wired mouse. I mostly play Minecraft, and it has worked great for that. The buttons are a little more sensitive than other mouses I've used, and sometimes I accidentally click or accidentally DOUBLE click when I meant to only click once (wasted a lot of torches this way) but that may be me being too heavy-handed and needing to get used to it. It's comfortable and very cute, I love the colors!",5

Vadim,Great,2024-04-01,good mouse for gaming,4
OG danksta,Good gaming mouse,2024-03-24,Son loves it for his video games,4
Erick,Non responsive sometimes,2024-02-05,The mouse over all is amazing however I play a game where you have to click really fast and sometimes just doesn‚Äôt work.,4
Sudheer,Super light,2023-11-26,I had this mouse for a month i really haven't found any problems but the clicking is a little slow but for $15 it a fairly good mouse. I'm pretty surprised that it has a software and it is that good. However the DPI goes by a hundred instead of 50. Also the honeycomb design gives a good look and feel.,4
Isaiah pugh,price,2024-05-02,This is a W mouse for gaming and console users its good but its gets dirty quickly because its honey comb and i dont know how to open it without breaking it. But its good for the price,5
L,Product,2024-03-09,Just like description üëçüèº,4
TravellerBlues,just as good as well known 'pro' gaming mice of similar design,2024-04-09,"I bought this mouse for my daughter, and used it a few times myself on her PC. I see no difference from my Logitech and Steel Series, other than it's pink, and the RGB is brighter with a different pattern. pink nylon covered cord is a nice touch.",5
S. Ruffin,"Light, comfortable, but...",2023-12-05,"While the mouse is light, comfortable, and pretty well built for its price, the red laser light inside the mouse, which guides the cursor, can pop through the honeycombs and hit you in the eye which is very uncomfortable. Make sure to protect your eyes.",4
Bubba,Not plug and play ready,2024-03-04,"I have a Mac, so I knew I would not be able to use the drivers, but was just gonna use it straight out of the box as a gaming mouse for my PS5. I unboxed it and hooked it up and the scroll wheel is not set up. So the only way to be able to use it, is to get a windows pc and download and run the software. Def seems like a good mouse for the price, just make sure you have windows to run the software.",3

Bueno producto,Econ√≥mico y eficiente,2024-05-06,"Funciones y software interactivo, por mejorar el material del equipo",5
Paul & Destoni R.,Honestly concerned about the honeycomb design,2023-05-29,"I knew that this mouse has a honeycomb design, but I thought there would be a plastic casing on the inside. No it is just fully open, you can see the components of the mouse inside. It's concerning because dust and debris is starting to fall in there. It is indeed a lightweight mouse and good for the price but you will have to use compressed air to clean it out like your keyboard so if it's too much for you, get a different kind of mouse",4
darvan123,Surprisingly nice mouse.,2023-02-10,Before I bought this mouse I had a Glorious model D. One day my teenage daughter stole my model D and dumped her heavy pink razer gaming mouse at my desk as a trade off. It was so heavy I had gotten spoiled from the light weight of the model D. I decided to try out this one and I didn't regret it at all. They are quite similar and both glide very smooth on the desk pad. The only difference that I noticed is that you have to press just a bit harder on this mouse to register. Some people might prefer that. It's worth it for the price.,4
S. Lee,Great mouse,2023-03-28,"This is a really solid gaming mouse, its lightweight and doesn't leave my palms sweaty. The two things I don't like: 1. the inability to turn off or change the rainbow lights. I love the lights but it'd be nice to turn it off since it can be bright or distracting after awhile. 2. the shape of the mouse is slightly bigger than I care for. It's not terribly uncomfortable at the moment but I could see this being a problem if I used it over a very long period of time. Otherwise, I do really like this mouse and would recommend it.",4
George M.,comfortable,2024-04-01,Was purchased for my sons cpu. He loves this mouse and says its very comfortable. Easy to use for gaming and highly recommends,5

Gavin Cross,Wow!,2023-09-02,If this isn't a steal I don't know what is. I actually had the steel series mouse that looks identical to this one and is about x4 the price. Everything works exactly the same though and didn't put a dent in my bank account. There are a lot of janky cheap tech products out there but this isn't one of them. Only issue I can complain about is the box came banged up a tad but I am sure it didn't start that way with the company.,5
Great for price,Good feeling,2024-03-03,For the price you get a simple and light mouse and it has good options with the dpi and helps alot in gaming.,5

Alex Hernaez,The weight is not accurate,2023-11-23,I was kinda disappointed of how heavy the mouse is I thought I was 70 someone grams but it's feels like over 100g The feeling is nice the materials are good if your looking for gaming I would recommend a light mouse but if your just looking for looks then this mouse is for you. I will be selling this mouse because of how heavy it is and replacing this with a lighter mouse.,3
Oneminutes,Can't clean inside,2024-04-05,there is no way to unscrew the top so that you can clean it,3
Cameron Hereford,Lack of reliability,2024-05-13,"Product had a shortage that caused it to work only sporadically. When working, the mouse was good, but it would only work part of the time. I had to keep maneuvering the USB inside the port to get the mouse to connect and function. Sometimes it would work quickly and other times it would take many minutes just to get the mouse work on screen. I tested those ports on my computer with different products, and they all worked fine when something else was plugged into them. Showing the mouse was faulty.",2
