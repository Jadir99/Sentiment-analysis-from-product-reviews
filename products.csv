0,Audrey,Finally! I absolutely love this chair,2024-10-03,"Very easy to assemble, love the hight of the back of the chair. It is very sturdy, and the reclining feature has me hooked because I know it’s hard to find a chair that keeps your back from hurting. Worth every dollar",5
1,a.spencer,Awesome chair,2024-09-07,"My son wanted a gaming chair. He found this online and I got it on lightning deal. He’s been very happy with it. Seems of good quality and comfy, he spends hours in the evenings in it between homework, gaming and just talking on the phone.",5
2,Prewar Mangold,Super comfy chair,2024-04-23,"This chair is seriously comfy. The ergonomic design is on point, and the footrest is a game-changer (pun intended). Whether you're gaming or working, you'll appreciate the support it provides.",4
3,Tricia,Decent chair,2024-09-06,"We've had this for about a month now, very nice chair comfortable, my boys use it and have no complaints. Seems to hold up when my kids rage at gaming. My husband didn't have and issue assembling it. Very stable and fits great in our family room.",5
4,DP,Good Chair!!,2024-09-15,Good chair and even though there was technical difficulties GTracing made it right.,5
5,Dtae,Love it,2024-08-25,Fast shipping easy to set up!,5
6,Ericka,Comfortable,2024-10-12,I wouldn’t use it as a gaming chair but it’s still a nice chair to have. The pull out leg rest gets stuck but besides that it’s a nice chair to sit and watch tv in for short periods of time in.,3
7,Greg,Kid approved,2024-05-19,Loved the color and how easy it moved. Assembling wasn’t the best but we knew it wasn’t coming assembled so that is what it is.,5
8,beth leach,Great,2024-09-15,Son loves it just complains it needs more padding in the seat,4
9,Sebas,Comodo pero no la reposadera,2024-07-30,"En comparacion con otras sillas esta se siente un poco plastica, siento que le hace falta mas acolchado, se siente muy rigida pero eso al final realmente no lo tomo en cuenta, por eso mi calificacion, pero... si es impotante para mi que el reposabrazos tenga algun tipo de colcha o que sea comodo, este no trae nada, me toco ponerle algo porque no soportaba la incomodidad",4
10,E. Moore,Just Ok.,2024-06-02,"The chair is just ok. I had higher expectations, and my corsair gaming chair at my other desk is better. If corsair hadn't discontinued it, I would have gotten that one. Here are my gripes with this chair. Assembly was easy enough but certain parts didn't want to line up all that well. The armrests are HARD plastic. After an hour gaming in this chair, I find myself wishing it had no armrests at all, thats how hard the plastic is. I am likely going to figure out some way to wrap the arms in foam myself. For now, I usually just try to angle them outward so that I have the option to not use them. The foam of the chair itself is a very dense, hard foam. If you're looking for something ultra cushy, this isn't it. I am ok with the foam though. As for the dimensions, the chair is wide enough for me to sit with my legs crossed under me, so that's a major plus. The foot rest that extends out feels unsturdy and like it's going to break someday, so I just don't use it. All in all, I give it a 6/10. It lost major points with me on the armrests.",3
11,Blair,comfortable and sturdy,2024-08-14,The hubby seems to love it!!!,5
12,JennA,Great Entry Level Chair,2024-06-02,My husband purchased this for his gaming system. It was easy to put together and has some nice features. See my video for all the fun details! He says it’s not as comfortable as his office chair (which is a really nice one) but it does the job!,5
13,Cheyanne,Awesome chair,2024-07-09,"It’s is the perfect size and super comfy, great quality & value.",5
14,Mario Moncada,Comfy,2024-02-27,Its a good chair and I get a good deal. The only thing that I dont like to much are the arms,4
15,JoAnn,Great chair,2024-06-24,The chair was a gift and was really perfect. He’s enjoying the comfort.,5
16,Glen V.,"Okay chair, poor customer service",2024-03-01,"Got the chair and started to put it together and found the piece that you push to raise or lower the arm was broken. Contacted customer service and they wanted my to send them a video of the issue. I just used a screwdriver to raise the arm and will leave it raised. Not worth the hassle of taking and sending a video. I guess if customer service goal was to not send broken part, they won. Overall the chair is okay, just kind of a bad experience. Beware.",3
17,Romero,Good,2024-05-14,It’s great buy mine had a little hole. Hasn’t stretched so far but I know it’s gonna happen some day. Didn’t return because I had already built it.,5
18,Ryan Gross,Love it.,2024-05-13,Have had it 6 months now and use it daily for hours and it still looks and feels like the day I bought it.,5
19,brian,plastic arm rests,2024-05-04,Why would anyone make hard plastic arm rests it doesn't make any sense. Other then that its fine,3
20,Destiny Parks,Awesome!!!,2024-03-05,"My son’s favorite gift he got! The foot part pulls out, the chair reclines, the arms can be lifted and lowered and also moved out. Pretty sturdy and comfy. Not hard to put together at all.",5
21,Ali,Comfortable,2024-01-26,"Great chair! I was a little worried after reading some of the poor reviews, but the chair is actually pretty sturdy. Love the reclining feature. I use this as my office chair and sit for hours at a time and I am comfortable.",5

27,Bryan Thompson,Hard to assemble and uncomfortable,2024-04-13,This chair was unreasonably difficult to assemble. Very poor instructions and illustrations. After 2 hours I sat in it and was very uncomfortable. Another 1/2 hour to finally position the headrest and lumbar support. The armrests are hard as is the rest of the chair. The only thing I like about this chair is how it looks and the lumbar support is nice.,2
28,Ashley W.,Comfy,2024-02-11,Very comfy and sturdy. Love the foot rest.,5
29,Amazon Customer,Great chair,2024-03-01,I like it,5
30,A. French,Minimalistic comfort,2024-01-24,Nice chair for the money but not without its downsides...had a hole in the back of the seat as seen in the photo and was missing hardware. Luckily I'm a gear head and have crap laying around. As for the puncture in the seat out of the box... pretty disappointing since the box was in good shape. Chair is comfy and offers more support than my old one but the hole and missing parts seems to be a trend. This two star review.,2
31,nikita g.,Rock-hard armrests hurt elbows,2024-10-15,Rock hard armrests hurting my elbows. Will need to come up with something to cushion them or get a better quality chair. You guys should add in the description that the armrests are rockhard,1
32,Joseph Torres,Amazing,2024-01-28,Love the chair it’s amazing,5
33,Paul Shamblin,DO NOT BUY,2024-04-18,"Not one measurement on the product dimensions is correct. It is about 3-4 inches shorter overall. Also about an 1.5” more narrow than the measurements on Amazon. Measured for the desk I have and this chair is pointless now. I would return it but, the only Amazon drop off near me refuses to take any large boxes. Now I’m stuck with a chair I can’t use",1
34,Stacy M.,Would not buy again!,2024-01-27,"This is a small chair, it feels cheap. Not impressed. Would keep your money.",2
